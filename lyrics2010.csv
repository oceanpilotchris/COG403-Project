With her latest frame in the lead, Perry passes Mariah Carey, who\'s totaled 45 weeks at No. 1  Here\'s an updated look at the acts to spend the most time at No. 1 dating to the Oct. 3, 1992, launch of the Nielsen BDS-based tally, which measures the most weekly plays at mainstream top 40 stations:  Weeks at No. 1, Artist 46, Katy Perry 45, Mariah Carey 32, P!nk 32, Rihanna 29, Ace of Base 26, Maroon 5 25, Christina Aguilera 23, Beyonce 23, Boyz II Men 23, Nelly  Perry has earned her record-breaking feat courtesy of 11 Pop Songs No. 1s, also a chart best-sum, which she shares with Rihanna. (Notably, the careers of artists like Carey and Boyz II Men pre-date the Pop Songs chart\'s inception.) Of Perry\'s 11 leaders, ""Horse"" is the eighth to rule for at least four weeks. She set a personal best when ""California Gurls,"" featuring Snoop Dogg, dominated for seven weeks in 2010  On its way to granting Perry her latest piece of Pop Songs history, ""Horse"" last week set the mark for the most weekly plays (16,151) in the chart\'s archives.

Ay! Somebody bring me back some money please', 'From whom, and for what reason, the city of Rome, a name so great in glory, and famous in the mouths of all men, was so first called, authors do not agree. Some are of opinion that the Pelasgians, wandering over the greater part of the habitable world, and subduing numerous nations, fixed themselves here, and, from their own great strength in war, called the city Rome. Others, that at the taking of Troy, some few that escaped and met with shipping, put to sea, and driven by winds, were carried upon the coasts of Tuscany, and came to anchor off the mouth of the river Tiber, where their women, out of heart and weary with the sea, on its being proposed by one of the highest birth and best understanding amongst them, whose name was Roma, burnt the ships. With which act the men at first were angry, but afterwards, of necessity, seating themselves near Palatium, where things in a short while succeeded far better than they could hope, in that they found the country very good, and the people courteous, they not only did the lady Roma other honours, but added also this, of calling after her name the city which she had been the occasion of their founding. From this, they say, has come down that custom at Rome for women to salute their kinsmen and husbands with kisses; because these women, after they had burnt the ships, made use of such endearments when entreating and pacifying their husbands.  Some again say that Roma, from whom this city was so called, was daughter of Italus and Leucaria; or, by another account, of Telaphus, Hercules\'s son, and that she was married to Aeneas, or, according to others again, to Ascanius, Aeneas\'s son. Some tell us that Romanus, the son of Ulysses and Circe, built it; some, Romus, the son of Emathion, Diomede having sent him from Troy; and others, Romus, king of the Latins, after driving out the Tyrrhenians, who had come from Thessaly into Lydia, and from thence into Italy. Those very authors, too, who, in accordance with the safest account, make Romulus give the name of the city, yet differ concerning his birth and family. For some say, he was son to Aeneas and Dexithea, daughter of Phorbas, and was, with his brother Remus, in their infancy, carried into Italy, and being on the river when the waters came down in a flood, all the vessels were cast away except only that where the young children were, which being gently landed on a level bank of the river, they were both unexpectedly saved, and from them the place was called Rome. Some say, Roma, daughter of the Trojan lady above mentioned, was married to Latinus, Telemachus\'s son, and became mother to Romulus; others that Aemilia, daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia, had him by the god Mars; and others give you mere fables of his origin. For to Tarchetius, they say, king of Alba, who was a most wicked and cruel man, there appeared in his own house a strange vision, a male figure that rose out of a hearth, and stayed there for many days. There was an oracle of Tethys in Tuscany which Tarchetius consulted, and received an answer that a virgin should give herself to the apparition, and that a son should be born of her, highly renowned, eminent for valour, good fortune, and strength of body. Tarchetius told the prophecy to one of his own daughters, and commanded her to do this thing; which she avoiding as an indignity, sent her handmaid. Tarchetius, hearing this, in great anger imprisoned them both, purposing to put them to death, but being deterred from murder by the goddess Vesta in a dream, enjoined them for their punishment the working a web of cloth, in their chains as they were, which when they finished, they should be suffered to marry; but whatever they worked by day, Tarchetius commanded others to unravel in the night.  In the meantime, the waiting-woman was delivered of two boys, whom Tarchetius gave into the hands of one Teratius, with command to destroy them; he, however, carried and laid them by the river side, where a wolf came and continued to suckle them, while birds of various sorts brought little morsels of food, which they put into their mouths; till a cowherd, spying them, was first strangely surprised, but, venturing to draw nearer, took the children up in his arms. Thus they were saved, and when they grew up, set upon Tarchetius and overcame him. This one Promathion says, who compiled a history of Italy.  But the story which is most believed and has the greatest number of vouchers was first published, in its chief particulars, amongst the Greeks by Diocles of Peparethus, whom Fabius Pictor also follows in most points. Here again there are variations, but in general outline it runs thus: the kings of Alba reigned in lineal descent from Aeneas, and the succession devolved at length upon two brothers, Numitor and Amulius. Amulius proposed to divide things into two equal shares, and set as equivalent to the kingdom the treasure and gold that were brought from Troy. Numitor chose the kingdom; but Amulius, having the money, and being able to do more with that than Numitor, took his kingdom from him with great ease, and, fearing lest his daughter might have children, made her a Vestal, bound in that condition forever to live a single and maiden life. This lady some call Ilia, others Rhea, and others Silvia; however, not long after, she was, contrary to the established laws of the Vestals, discovered to be with child, and should have suffered the most cruel punishment, had not Antho, the king\'s daughter, mediated with her father for her; nevertheless, she was confined, and debarred all company, that she might not be delivered without the king\'s knowledge. In time she brought forth two boys, of more than human size and beauty, whom Amulius, becoming yet more alarmed, commanded a servant to take and cast away; this man some call Faustulus, others say Faustulus was the man who brought them up. He put the children, however, in a small trough, and. went towards the river with a design to cast them in; but, seeing the waters much swollen and coming violently down, was afraid to go nearer, and dropping the children near the bank, went away. The river overflowing, the flood at last bore up the trough, and, gently wafting it, landed them on a smooth piece of ground, which they now called Cermanus, formerly Germanus, perhaps from Germani with signifies brothers.  Near this place grew a wild fig-tree, which they called Ruminalis, either from Romulus (as it is vulgarly thought), or from ruminating, because cattle did usually in the heat of the day seek cover under it, and there chew the cud; or, better, from the suckling of these children there, for the ancients called the dug or teat of any creature ruma; and there is a tutelar goddess of the rearing of children whom they still call Rumilia, in sacrificing to whom they use no wine, but make libations of milk. While the infants lay here, history tells us, a she-wolf nursed them, and a woodpecker constantly fed and watched them; these creatures are esteemed holy to the god Mars; the woodpecker the Latins still especially worship and honour. Which things, as much as any, gave credit to what the mother of the children said, that their father was the god Mars; though some say that it was a mistake put upon her by Amulius, who himself had come to her dressed up in armour.  Others think that the first rise of this fable came from the children\'s nurse, through the ambiguity of her name; for the Latins not only called wolves lupoe, but also women of loose life; and such an one was the wife of Faustulus, who nurtured these children, Acca Larentia by name. To her the Romans offer sacrifices, and in the month of April the priest of Mars makes libations there; it is called the Larentian Feast. They honour also another Larentia, for the following reason: the keeper of Hercules\'s temple having, it seems, little else to do, proposed to his deity a game at dice, laying down that, if he himself won, he would have something valuable of the god; but if he were beaten, he would spread him a noble table, and procure him a fair lady\'s company. Upon these terms, throwing first for the god and then for himself, he found himself beaten. Wishing to pay his stakes honourably, and holding himself bound by what he had said, he both provided the diety a good supper, and giving money to Larentia, then in her beauty, though not publicly known, gave her a feast in the temple, where he had also laid a bed, and after supper locked her in, as if the god were really to come to her. And indeed, it is said, the deity did truly visit her, and commanded her in the morning to walk to the marketplace, and, whatever man she met first, to salute him, and make him her friend. She met one named Tarrutius, who was a man advanced in years, fairly rich, without children, and had always lived a single life. He received Larentia, and loved her well, and at his death left her sole heir of all his large and fair possessions, most of which she, in her last will and testament, bequeathed to the people. It was reported of her, being now celebrated and esteemed the mistress of a god, that she suddenly disappeared near the place where the first Larentia lay buried; the spot is at this day called Velabrum, because, the river frequently overflowing, they went over in ferry-boats somewhere hereabouts to the forum, the Latin word for ferrying being velatura. Others derive the name from velum, a sail; because the exhibitors of public shows used to hang the road that leads from the forum to the Circus Maximus with sails, beginning at this spot. Upon these accounts the second Larentia is honoured at Rome.  Meantime Faustulus, Amulius\'s swineherd, brought up the children without any man\'s knowledge; or, as those say who wish to keep closer to probabilities, with the knowledge and secret assistance of Numitor; for it is said, they went to school at Gabii, and were well instructed in letters, and other accomplishments befitting their birth. And they were called Romulus and Remus (from ruma, the dug), as we had before, because they were found sucking the wolf. In their very infancy, the size and beauty of their bodies intimated their natural superiority; and when they grew up, they both proved brave and manly, attempting all enterprises that seemed hazardous, and showing in them a courage altogether undaunted. But Romulus seemed rather to act by counsel, and to show the sagacity of a statesman, and in all his dealings with their neighbours, whether relating to feeding of flocks or to hunting, gave the idea of being born rather to rule than to obey. To their comrades and inferiors they were therefore dear; but the king\'s servants, his bailiffs and overseers, as being in nothing better than themselves, they despised and slighted, nor were the least concerned at their commands and menaces. They used honest pastimes and liberal studies, not esteeming sloth and idleness honest and liberal, but rather such exercises as hunting and running, repelling robbers, taking of thieves, and delivering the wronged and oppressed from injury. For doing such things they became famous.  A quarrel occurring betwixt Numitor\'s and Amulius\'s cowherds, the latter, not enduring the driving away of their cattle by the others, fell upon them and put them to flight, and rescued the greatest part of the prey. At which Numitor being highly incensed, they little regarded it, but collected and took into their company a number of needy men and runaway slaves,- acts which looked like the first stages of rebellion. It so happened that when Romulus was attending a sacrifice, being fond of sacred rites and divination, Numitor\'s herdsmen, meeting with Remus on a journey with few companions, fell upon him, and after some fighting, took him prisoner, carried him before Numitor, and there accused him. Numitor would not punish him himself, fearing his brother\'s anger, but went to Amulius, and desired justice, as he was Amulius\'s brother and was affronted by Amulius\'s servants. The men of Alba likewise resenting the thing, and thinking he had been dishonourably used, Amulius was induced to deliver Remus up into Numitor\'s hands, to use him as he thought fit. He therefore took and carried him home, and, being struck with admiration of the youth\'s person, in stature aid strength of body exceeding all men, and perceiving in his very countenance the courage and force of his mind, which stood unsubdued and unmoved by his present circumstances, and hearing further that all the enterprises and actions of his life were answerable to what he saw of but chiefly, as it seemed, a divine influence aiding and directing the first steps that were to lead to great results, out of the mere thought of his mind and casually, as it were, he put his hand upon the fact, and, in gentle terms and with a kind aspect, to inspire him with confidence and hope, asked him who he was, and whence he was derived. He, taking heart, spoke thus: ""I will hide nothing from you, for you seem to be of a more princely temper than Amulius, in that you give a hearing and examine before you punish, while he condemns before the cause is heard. Formerly, then, we (for we are twins) thought ourselves the sons of Faustulus and Larentia, the king\'s servants; but since we have been accused and aspersed with calumnies, and brought in peril of our lives here before you, we hear great things of ourselves, the truth of which my present danger is likely to bring to the test. Our birth is said to have been secret, our fostering and nurture in our infancy still more strange; by birds and beasts, to whom we were cast out, we were fed, by the milk of a wolf and the morsels of a woodpecker, as we lay in a little trough by the side of the river. The trough is still in being, and is preserved, with brass plates round it, and an inscription in letters almost effaced, which may prove hereafter unavailing tokens to our parents when we are dead and gone."" Numitor, upon these words, and computing the dates by the young man\'s looks, slighted not the hope that flattered him, but considered how to come at his daughter privately (for she was still kept under restraint), to talk with her concerning these matters.  Faustulus, hearing Remus was taken and delivered up, called on Romulus to assist in his rescue, informing him then plainly of the particulars of his birth, not but he had before given hints of it, and told as much as an attentive man might make no small conclusions from; he himself, full of concern and fear of not coming in time, took the trough, and ran instantly to Numitor; but giving a suspicion to some of the king\'s sentries at his gate, and being gazed upon by them and perplexed with their questions, he let it be seen that he was hiding the trough under his cloak. By chance there was one among them who was at the exposing of the children, and was employed in the office; he, seeing the trough and knowing it by its make and inscription, guessed at the business, and, without further delay, telling the king of it, brought in the man to be examined. Faustulus, hard beset, did not show himself altogether proof against terror; nor yet was he wholly forced out of all; confessed indeed the children were alive, but lived, he said, as shepherds, a great way from Alba; he himself was going to carry the trough to Ilia, who had often greatly desired to see and handle it, for a confirmation of her hopes of her children. As men generally do who are troubled in mind and act either in fear or passion, it so fell out Amulius now did; for he sent in haste as a messenger, a man, otherwise honest, and friendly to Numitor, with commands to learn from Numitor whether any tidings were come to him of the children being alive. He, coming and seeing how little Remus wanted of being received into the arms and embraces of Numitor, both gave him surer confidence in his hope, and advised them, with all expedition, to proceed to action; himself too joining and assisting them, and indeed, had they wished it, the time would not have let them demur. For Romulus was now come very near, and many of the citizens, out of fear and hatred of Amulius, were running out to join him; besides, he brought great forces with him, divided into companies each of an hundred men, every captain carrying a small bundle of grass and shrubs tied to a pole. The Latins call such bundles manipuli, and from hence it is that in their armies they still call their captains manipulares. Remus rousing the citizens within to revolt, and Romulus making attacks from without, the tyrant, not knowing either what to do, or what expedient to think of for his security, in this perplexity and confusion was taken and put to death. This narrative for the most part given by Fabius and Diocles of Peparethus, who seem to be the earliest historians of the foundation of Rome, is suspected by some, because of its dramatic and fictitious appearance; but it would not wholly be disbelieved, if men would remember what a poet fortune sometimes shows herself, and consider that the Roman power would hardly have reached so high a pitch without a divinely ordered origin, attended with great and extraordinary circumstances.  Amulius now being dead and matters quietly disposed, the two brothers would neither dwell in Alba without governing there, nor take the government into their own hands during the life of their grandfather. Having therefore delivered the dominion up into his hands, and paid their mother befitting honour, they resolved to live by themselves, and build a city in the same place where they were in their infancy brought up. This seems the most honourable reason for their departure; though perhaps it was necessary, having such a body of slaves and fugitives collected about them, either to come to nothing by dispersing them, or if not so, then to live with them elsewhere. For that the inhabitants of Alba did not think fugitives worthy of being received and incorporated as citizens among them plainly appears from the matter of the women, an attempt made not wantonly but of necessity, because they could not get wives by good-will. For they certainly paid unusual respect and honour to those whom they thus forcibly seized.  Not long after the first foundation of the city, they opened a sanctuary of refuge for all fugitives, which they called the temple of the god Asylaeus, where they received and protected all, delivering none back, neither the servant to his master, the debtor to his creditor, nor the murderer into the hands of the magistrate, saying it was a privileged place, and they could so maintain it by an order of the holy oracle; insomuch that the city grew presently very populous, for they say, it consisted at first of no more than a thousand houses. But of that hereafter.  Their minds being full bent upon building, there arose presently a difference about the place. Romulus chose what was called Roma Quadrata, or the Square Rome, and would have the city there. Remus laid out a piece of ground on the Aventine Mount, well fortified by nature, which was from him called Remonium, but now Rignarium. Concluding at last to decide the contest by a divination from a flight of birds, and placing themselves apart at some distance. Remus, they say, saw six vultures, and Romulus double that number; others say, Remus did truly see his number, and that Romulus feigned his, but when Remus came to him, that then he did indeed see twelve. Hence it is that the Romans, in their divinations from birds, chiefly regard the vulture, though Herodorus Ponticus relates that Hercules was always very joyful when a vulture appeared to him upon any action. For it is a creature the least hurtful of any, pernicious neither to corn, fruit-tree, nor cattle; it preys only upon carrion, and never kills or hurts any living thing; and as for birds, it touches not them, though they are dead, as being of its own species, whereas eagles, owls, and hawks mangle and kill their own fellow-creatures; yet, as Aeschylus says,-  ""What bird is clean that preys on fellow bird?"" Besides, all other birds are, so to say, never out of our eyes; they let themselves be seen of us continually; but a vulture is a very rare sight, and you can seldom meet with a man that has seen their young; their rarity and infrequency has raised a strange opinion in some, that they come to us from some other world; as soothsayers ascribe a divine origination to all things not produced either of nature or of themselves.  When Remus knew the cheat, he was much displeased; and as Romulus was casting up a ditch, where he designed the foundation of the city-wall, he turned some pieces of the work to ridicule, and obstructed others; at last, as he was in contempt leaping over it, some say Romulus himself struck him, others Celer, one of his companions; he fell, however, and in the scuffle Faustulus also was slain, and Plistinus, who, being Faustulus\'s brother, story tells us, helped to bring up Romulus. Celer upon this fled instantly into Tuscany, and from him the Romans call all men that are swift of feet Celeres; and because Quintus Metellus, at his father\'s funeral, in a few days\' time gave the people a show of gladiators, admiring his expedition in getting it ready, they gave him the name of Celer.  Romulus, having buried his brother Remus, together with his two foster-fathers, on the mount Remonia, set to building his city; and sent for men out of Tuscany, who directed him by sacred usages and written rules in all the ceremonies to be observed, as in a religious rite. First, they dug a round trench about that which is now the Comitium, or Court of Assembly, and into it solemnly threw the first-fruits of all things either good by custom or necessary by nature; lastly, every man taking a small piece of earth of the country from whence he came, they all threw in promiscuously together. This trench they call, as they do the heavens, Mundus; making which their centre, they described the city in a circle round it. Then the founder fitted to a plough a brazen ploughshare, and, yoking together a bull and a cow, drove himself a deep line or furrow round the bounds; while the business of those that followed after was to see that whatever earth was thrown up should be turned all inwards towards the city; and not to let any clod lie outside. With this line they described the wall, and called it, by a contraction, Pomoerium, that is, postmurum, after or beside the wall; and where they designed to make a gate, there they took out the share, carried the plough over, and left a space; for which reason they consider the whole wall as holy, except where the gates are; for had they adjudged them also sacred, they could not, without offence to religion, have given free ingress and egress for the necessaries of human life, some of which are in themselves unclean.  As for the day they began to build the city, it is universally agreed to have been the twenty-first of April, and that day the Romans annually keep holy, calling it their country\'s birthday. At first, they say, they sacrificed no living creature on this day, thinking it fit to preserve the feast of their country\'s birthday pure and without stain of blood. Yet before ever the city was built, there was a feast of herdsmen and shepherds kept on this day, which went by the name of Palilia. The Roman and Greek months have now little or no agreement; they say, however, the day on which Romulus began to build was quite certainly the thirtieth of the month, at which time there was an eclipse of the sun which they conceived to be that seen by Antimachus, the Teian poet, in the third year of the sixth Olympiad. In the times of Varro the philosopher, a man deeply read in Roman history, lived one Tarrutius, his familiar acquaintance, a good philosopher and mathematician, and one, too, that out of curiosity had studied the way of drawing schemes and tables, and was thought to be a proficient in the art; to him Varro propounded to cast Romulus\'s nativity, even to the first day and hour, making his deductions from the several events of the man\'s life which he should be informed of, exactly as in working back a geometrical problem; for it belonged, he said, to the same science both to foretell a man\'s life by knowing the time of his birth, and also to find out his birth by the knowledge of his life. This task Tarrutius undertook, and first looking into the actions and casualties of the man, together with the time of his life and manner of his death, and then comparing all these remarks together, he very confidently and positively pronounced that Romulus was conceived in his mother\'s womb the first year of the second Olympiad, the twenty-third day of the month the Aegyptians call Choeac, and the third hour after sunset, at which time there was a total eclipse of the sun; that he was born the twenty-first day of the month Thoth, about sunrising; and that the first stone of Rome was laid by him the ninth day of the month Pharmuthi, between the second and third hour. For the fortunes of cities as well as of men, they think, have their certain periods of time prefixed, which may be collected and foreknown from the position of the stars at their first foundation. But these and the like relations may perhaps not so much take and delight the reader with their novelty and curiosity, as offend him by their extravagance.  The city now being built, Romulus enlisted all that were of age to bear arms into military companies, each company consisting of three thousand footmen and three hundred horse. These companies were called legions, because they were the choicest and most select of the people for fighting men. The rest of the multitude he called the people; an hundred of the most eminent he chose for counsellors; these he styled patricians, and their assembly the senate, which signifies a council of elders. The patricians, some say, were so called because they were the fathers of lawful children; others, because they could give a good account who their own fathers were, which not every one of the rabble that poured into the city at first could do; others, from patronage, their word for protection of inferiors, the origin of which they attribute to Patron, one of those that came over with Evander, who was a great protector and defender of the weak and needy. But perhaps the most probable judgment might be, that Romulus, esteeming it the duty of the chiefest and wealthiest men, with a fatherly care and concern to look after the meaner, and also encouraging the commonalty not to dread or be aggrieved at the honours of their superiors, but to love and respect them, and to think and call them their fathers, might from hence give them the name of patricians. For at this very time all foreigners give senators the style of lords; but the Romans, making use of a more honourable and less invidious name, call them Patres Conscripti; at first, indeed, simply Patres, but afterwards, more being added, Patres Conscripti. By this more imposing title he distinguished the senate from the populace; and in other ways separated the nobles and the commons, calling them patrons, and these their clients, by which means he created wonderful love and amity betwixt them, productive of great justice in their dealings. For they were always their clients\' counsellors in law cases, their advocates in courts of justice; in fine, their advisers and supporters in all affairs whatever. These again faithfully served their patrons, not only paying them all respect and deference, but also, in case of poverty, helping them to portion their daughters and pay off their debts; and for a patron to witness against his client, or a client against his patron, was what no law nor magistrate could enforce. In aftertimes, all other duties subsisting still between them, it was thought mean and dishonourable for the better sort to take money from their inferiors. And so much of these matters.  In the fourth month, after the city was built, as Fabius writes, the adventure of stealing the women was attempted and some say Romulus himself, being naturally a martial man, and predisposed too, perhaps by certain oracles, to believe the fates had ordained the future growth and greatness of Rome should depend upon the benefit of war, upon these accounts first offered violence to the Sabines, since he took away only thirty virgins, more to give an occasion of war than out of any want of women. But this is not very probable; it would seem rather that, observing his city to be filled by a confluence of foreigners, a few of whom had wives, and that the multitude in general, consisting of a mixture of mean and obscure men, fell under contempt, and seemed to be of no long continuance together, and hoping farther, after the women were appeased, to make this injury in some measure an occasion of confederacy and mutual commerce with the Sabines, he took in hand this exploit after this manner. First, he gave it out as if he had found an altar of a certain god hid under ground; the god they called Consus, either the god of counsel (for they still call a consultation consilium, and their chief magistrates consules, namely, counsellors), or else the equestrian Neptune, for the altar is kept covered in the Circus Maximus at all other times, and only at horse-races is exposed to public view; others merely say that this god had his altar hid under ground because counsel ought to be secret and concealed. Upon discovery of this altar, Romulus, by proclamation, appointed a day for a splendid sacrifice, and for public games and shows, to entertain all sorts of people: many flocked thither, and he himself sat in front, amidst his nobles clad in purple. Now the signal for their falling on was to be whenever he rose and gathered up his robe and threw it over his body; his men stood all ready armed, with their eyes intent upon him, and when the sign was given, drawing their swords and falling on with a great shout they ravished away the daughters of the Sabines, they themselves flying without any let or hindrance. They say there were but thirty taken, and from them the Curiae or Fraternities were named; but Valerius Antias says five hundred and twenty-seven, Juba, six hundred and eighty-three virgins: which was indeed the greatest excuse Romulus could allege, namely, that they had taken no married woman, save one only, Hersilia by name, and her too unknowingly; which showed that they did not commit this rape wantonly, but with a design purely of forming alliance with their neighbours by the greatest and surest bonds. This Hersilia some say Hostilius married, a most eminent man among the Romans; others, Romulus himself, and that she bore two children to him,- a daughter, by reason of primogeniture called Prima, and one only son, whom, from the great concourse of citizens to him at that time, he called Aollius, but after ages Abillius. But Zenodotus the Troezenian, in giving this account, is contradicted by many.  Among those who committed this rape upon the virgins, there were, they say, as it so then happened, some of the meaner sort of men, who were carrying off a damsel, excelling all in beauty and comeliness and stature, whom when some of superior rank that met them, attempted to take away, they cried out they were carrying her to Talasius, a young man, indeed, but brave and worthy; hearing that, they commended and applauded them loudly, and also some, turning back, accompanied them with good-will and pleasure, shouting out the name of Talasus. Hence the Romans to this very time, at their weddings, sing Talasius for their nuptial word, as the Greeks do Hymenaeus, because they say Talasius was very happy in his marriage. But Sextius Sylla the Carthaginian, a man wanting neither learning nor ingenuity, told me Romulus gave this word as a sign when to begin the onset; everybody, therefore, who made prize of a maiden, cried out, Talasius; and for that reason the custom continues so now at marriages. But most are of opinion (of whom Juba particularly is one) that this word was used to new-married women by way of incitement to good housewifery and talasia (spinning), as we say in Greek, Greek words at that time not being as yet overpowered by Italian. But if this be the case, and if the Romans did at the time use the word talasia as we do, a man might fancy a more probable reason of the custom. For when the Sabines, after the war against the Romans were reconciled, conditions were made concerning their women, that they should be obliged to do no other servile offices to their husbands but what concerned spinning; it was customary, therefore, ever after, at weddings, for those that gave the bride or escorted her or otherwise were present, sportingly to say Talasius, intimating that she was henceforth to serve in spinning and no more. It continues also a custom at this very day for the bride not of herself to pass her husband\'s threshold, but to be lifted over, in memory that the Sabine virgins were carried in by violence, and did not go in of their own will. Some say, too, the custom of parting the bride\'s hair with the head of a spear was in token their marriages began at first by war and acts of hostility, of which I have spoken more fully in my book of Questions.  This rape was committed on the eighteenth day of the month Sextilis, now called August, on which the solemnities of the Consualia are kept.  The Sabines were a numerous and martial people, but lived in small, unfortified villages, as it befitted, they thought, a colony of the Lacedaemonians to be bold and fearless; nevertheless, seeing themselves bound by such hostages to their good behaviour, and being solicitous for their daughters, they sent ambassadors to Romulus with fair and equitable requests, that he would return their young women and recall that act of violence, and afterwards, by persuasion and lawful means, seek friendly correspondence between both nations. Romulus would not part with the young women, yet proposed to the Sabines to enter into an alliance with them; upon which point some consulted and demurred long, but Acron, king of the Ceninenses, a man of high spirit and a good warrior, who had all along a jealousy of Romulus\'s bold attempts, and considering particularly, from this exploit upon the women, that he was growing formidable to all people, and indeed insufferable, were he not chastised, first rose up in arms, and with a powerful army advanced against him. Romulus likewise prepared to receive him; but when they came within sight and viewed each other, they made a challenge to fight a single duel, the armies standing by under arms, without participation. And Romulus, making a vow to Jupiter, if he should conquer, to carry himself, and dedicate his adversary\'s armour to his honour, overcame him in combat, and a battle ensuing, routed his army also, and then took his city; but did those he found in it no injury, only commanded them to demolish the place and attend him to Rome, there to be admitted to all the privileges of citizens. And indeed there was nothing did more advance the greatness of Rome, than that she did always unite and incorporate those whom she conquered into herself. Romulus, that he might perform his vow in the most acceptable manner to Jupiter, and withal make the pomp of it delightful to the eye of the city, cut down a tall oak which he saw growing in the camp, which he trimmed to the shape of a trophy, and fastened on it Acron\'s whole suit of armour disposed in proper form; then he himself, girding his clothes about him, and crowning his head with a laurel garland, his hair gracefully flowing, carried the trophy resting erect upon his right shoulder, and so marched on, singing songs of triumph, and his whole army following after, the citizens all receiving him with acclamations of joy and wonder. The procession of this day was the origin and model of all after triumphs. This trophy was styled an offering to Jupiter Feretrius, from ferire, which in Latin is to smite; for Romulus prayed he might smite and overthrow his enemy; and the spoils were called opima, or royal spoils, says Varro, from their richness, which the word opes signifies; though one would more probably conjecture from opus, an act; for it is only to the general of an army who with his own hand kills his enemies\' general that this honour is granted of offering the opima spolia. And three only of the Roman captains have had it conferred on them: first, Romulus, upon killing Acron the Ceninensian; next, Cornelius Cossus, for slaying Tolumnius the Tuscan; and lastly, Claudius Marcellus, upon his conquering Viridomarus, king of the Gauls. The two latter, Cossus and Marcellus, made their entries in triumphant chariots, bearing their trophies themselves; but that Romulus made use of a chariot, Dionysius is wrong in asserting. History says, Tarquinius, Damaratus\'s son, was the first that brought triumphs to this great pomp and grandeur; others, that Publicola was the first that rode in triumph. The statues of Romulus in triumph are, as may be seen in Rome, all on foot.  After the overthrow of the Ceninensians, the other Sabines still protracting the time in preparations, the people of Fidenae, Crustumerium, and Antemna joined their forces against the Romans; they in like manner were defeated in battle, and surrendered up to Romulus their cities to be seized, their lands and territories to be divided, and themselves to be transplanted to Rome. All the lands which Romulus acquired, he distributed among the citizens, except only what the parents of the stolen virgins had; these he suffered to possess their own. The rest of the Sabines, enraged hereat, choosing Tatius their captain, marched straight against Rome. The city was almost inaccessible, having for its fortress that which is now the Capitol, where a strong guard was placed, and Tarpeius their captain; not Tarpeia the virgin, as some say who would make Romulus a fool. But Tarpeia, daughter to the captain, coveting the golden bracelets she saw them wear, betrayed the fort into the Sabines\' hands, and asked, in reward of her treachery, the things they wore on their left arms. Tatius conditioning thus with her, in the night she opened one of the gates, and received the Sabines. And truly Antigonus, it would seem, was not solitary in saying he loved betrayers, but hated those who had betrayed; nor Caesar, who told Rhymitalces the Thracian, that he loved the treason, but hated the traitor; but it is the general feeling of all who have occasion for wicked men\'s service, as people have for the poison of venomous beasts; they are glad of them while they are of use, and abhor their baseness when it is over. And so then did Tatius behave towards Tarpeia, for he commanded the Sabines, in regard to their contract, not to refuse her the least part of what they wore on their left arms; and he himself first took his bracelet off his arm, and threw that, together with his buckler, at her; and all the rest following, she, being borne down and quite buried with the multitude of gold and their shields, died under the weight and pressure of them; Tarpeius also himself, being prosecuted by Romulus, was found guilty of treason, as Juba says Sulpicius Galba relates. Those who write otherwise concerning Tarpeia, as that she was the daughter of Tatius, the Sabine captain, and being forcibly detained by Romulus, acted and suffered thus by her father\'s contrivance, speak very absurdly, of whom Antigonus is one. And Simylus, the poet, who thinks Tarpeia betrayed the Capitol, not to the Sabines, but the Gauls, having fallen in love with their king, talks mere folly, saying thus:-  ""Tarpeia \'twas, who, dwelling close thereby, Laid open Rome unto the enemy, She, for the love of the besieging Gaul, Betrayed the city\'s strength, the Capitol.""  And a little after, speaking of her death:-  ""The numerous nations of the Celtic foe Bore her not living to the banks of Po; Their heavy shields upon the maid they threw, And with their splendid gifts entombed at once and slew.""  Tarpeia afterwards was buried there, and the hill from her was called Tarpeius, until the reign of King Tarquin, who dedicated the place to Jupiter, at which time her bones were removed, and so it lost her name, except only that part of the Capitol which they still called the Tarpeian Rock, from which they used to cast down malefactors.  The Sabines being possessed of the hill, Romulus, in great fury, bade them battle, and Tatius was confident to accept it, perceiving, if they were overpowered, that they had behind them a secure retreat. The level in the middle, where they were to join battle, being surrounded with many little hills seemed to enforce both parties to a sharp and desperate conflict, by reason of the difficulties of the place, which had but a few outlets, inconvenient either for refuge or pursuit. It happened, too, the river having overflowed not many days before, there was left behind in the plain, where now the forum stands, a deep blind mud and slime, which, though it did not appear much to the eye, and was not easily avoided, at bottom was deceitful and dangerous; upon which the Sabines being unwarily about to enter, met with a piece of good fortune; for Curtius, a gallant man, eager of honour, and of aspiring thoughts, being mounted on horseback, was galloping on before the rest, and mired his horse here, and, endeavouring for a while, by whip and spur and voice to disentangle him, but finding it impossible, quitted him and saved himself; the place from him to this very time is called the Curtian Lake. The Sabines, having avoided this danger, began the fight very smartly, the fortune of the day being very dubious, though many were slain; amongst whom was Hostilius, who, they say, was husband to Hersilia, and grandfather to that Hostilius who reigned after Numa. There were many other brief conflicts, we may suppose, but the most memorable was the last, in which Romulus, having received a wound on his head by a stone, and being almost felled to the ground by it, and disabled, the Romans gave way, and, being driven out of the level ground, fled towards the Palatium. Romulus, by this time recovering from his wound a little, turned about to renew the battle, and, facing the fliers, with a loud voice encouraged them to stand and fight. But being overborne with numbers, and nobody daring to face about, stretching out his hands to heaven, he prayed to Jupiter to stop the army, and not to neglect, but maintain the Roman cause, now in extreme danger. The prayer was no sooner made, than shame and respect for their king checked many; the fears of the fugitives changed suddenly into confidence. The place they first stood at was where now is the temple of Jupiter Stator (which may be translated the Stayer); there they rallied again into ranks and repulsed the Sabines to the place called now Regia, and to the temple of Vesta; where both parties, preparing to begin a second battle, were prevented by a spectacle, strange to behold, and defying description. For the daughters of the Sabines, who had been carried off, came running, in great confusion, some on this side, some on that, with miserable cries and lamentations, like creatures possessed, in the midst of the army and among the dead bodies, to come at their husbands and their fathers, some with their young babes in their arms, others their hair loose about their ears, but all calling, now upon the Sabines, now upon the Romans, in the most tender and endearing words. Hereupon both melted into compassion, and fell back, to make room for them betwixt the armies. The sight of the women carried sorrow and commiseration upon both sides into the hearts of all, but still more their words, which began with expostulation and upbraiding, and ended with entreaty and supplication.  ""Wherein,"" say they, ""have we injured or offended you, as to deserve such sufferings past and present? We were ravished away unjustly and violently by those whose now we are; that being done, we were so long neglected by our fathers, our brothers and countrymen, that time, having now by the strictest bonds united us to those we once mortally hated, has made it impossible for us not to tremble at the danger and weep at the death of the very men who once used violence to us. You did not come to vindicate our honour, while we were virgins, against our assailants; but do come now to force away wives from their husbands and mothers from their children, a succour more grievous to its wretched objects than the former betrayal and neglect of them. Which shall we call the worst, their love-making or your compassion? If you were making war upon any other occasion, for our sakes you ought to withhold your hands from those to whom we have made you fathers-in-law and grandsires. If it be for our own cause, then take us, and with us your sons-in-law and grandchildren. Restore to us our parents and kindred, but do not rob us of our children and husbands. Make us not, we entreat you, twice captives."" Hersilia having spoken many such words as these, and the others earnestly praying, a truce was made, and the chief officers came to a parley; the women, in the meantime, brought and presented their husbands and children to their fathers and brothers; gave those that wanted meat and drink, and carried the wounded home to be cured, and showed also how much they governed within doors, and how indulgent their husbands were to them, in demeaning themselves towards them with all kindness and respect imaginable. Upon this, conditions were agreed upon, that what women pleased might stay where they were, exempt, as aforesaid, from all drudgery and labour but spinning; that the Romans and Sabines should inhabit the city together; that the city should be called Rome from Romulus; but the Romans, Quirites, from the country of Tatius; and that they both should govern and command in common. The place of the ratification is still called Comitium, from come to meet.  The city being thus doubled in number, an hundred of the Sabines were elected senators, and the legions were increased to six thousand foot and six hundred horse; then they divided the people into three tribes: the first, from Romulus, named Ramnenses; the second from Tatius, Tatienses; the third Luceres, from the lucus, or grove, where the Asylum stood, whither many fled for sanctuary, and were received into the city. And that they were just three, the very name of tribe and tribune seems to show; each tribe contained ten curiae, or brotherhoods, which, some say, took their names from the Sabine women; but that seems to be false, because many had their names from various places. Though it is true, they then constituted many things in honour to the women; as to give them the way wherever they met them; to speak no ill word in their presence; not to appear naked before them, or else be liable to prosecution before the judge, of homicide; that their children should wear an ornament about their necks called the bulla (because it was like a bubble), and the proetexta, a gown edged with purple.  The princes did not immediately join in council together, but at first each met with his own hundred; afterwards all assembled together. Tatius dwelt where now the temple of Moneta stands, and Romulus, close by the steps, as they call them, of the Fair Shore, near the descent from the Mount Palatine to the Circus Maximus. There, they say, grew the holy cornel tree, of which they report, that Romulus once, to try his strength, threw a dart from the Aventine Mount, the staff of which was made of cornel, which struck so deep into the ground, that no one of many that tried could pluck it up, and the soil being fertile, gave nourishment to the wood, which sent forth branches, and produced a cornel stock of considerable bigness. This did posterity preserve and worship as one of the most sacred things; and therefore walled it about; and if to any one it appeared not green nor flourishing, but inclining to pine and wither, he immediately made outcry to all he met, and they, like people hearing of a house on fire, with one accord would cry for water, and run from all parts with buckets full to the place. But when Caius Caesar, they say, was repairing the steps about it, some of the labourers digging too close, the roots were destroyed, and the tree withered.  The Sabines adopted the Roman months, of which whatever is remarkable is mentioned in the Life of Numa. Romulus, on the other hand, adopted their long shields, and changed his own armour and that of all the Romans, who before wore round targets of the Argive pattern. Feasts and sacrifices they partook of in common, not abolishing any which either nation observed before, and instituting several new ones; of which one was the Matronalia, instituted in honour of the women, for their extinction of the war; likewise the Carmentalia. This Carmenta some think a deity presiding over human birth; for which reason she is much honoured by mothers. Others say she was the wife of Evander, the Arcadian, being a prophetess, and wont to deliver her oracles in verse, and from carmen, a verse, was called Carmenta; her proper name being Nicostrata. Others more probably derive Carmenta from carens mente, or insane, in allusion to her prophetic frenzies. Of the feast of Palilia we have spoken before. The Lupercalia, by the time of its celebration, may seem to be a feast of purification, for it is solemnised on the dies nefasti, or non-court days, of the month February, which name signifies purification, and the very day of the feast was anciently called Februata; but its name is equivalent to the Greek Lycaea; and it seems thus to be of great antiquity, and brought in by the Arcadians who came with Evander. Yet this is but dubious, for it may come as well from the wolf that nursed Romulus; and we see the Luperci, the priests, begin their course from the place where they say Romulus was exposed. But the ceremonies performed in it render the origin of the thing more difficult to be guessed at; for there are goats killed, then, two young noblemen\'s sons being brought, some are to stain their foreheads with the bloody knife, others presently to wipe it off with wool dipped in milk; then the young boys must laugh after their foreheads are wiped; that done, having cut the goats\' skins into thongs, they run about naked, only with something about their middle, lashing all they meet; and the young wives do not avoid their strokes, fancying they will help conception and childbirth. Another thing peculiar to this feast is for the Luperci to sacrifice a dog. But, as a certain poet who wrote fabulous explanations of Roman customs in elegiac verses, says, that Romulus and Remus, after the conquest of Amulius, ran joyfully to the place where the wolf gave them suck; and that, in imitation of that, this feast was held, and two young noblemen ran-  ""Striking at all, as when from Alba town, With sword in hand, the twins came hurrying down;"" and that the bloody knife applied to their foreheads was a sign of the danger and bloodshed of that day; the cleansing of them in milk, a remembrance of their food and nourishment. Caius Acilius writes, that, before the city was built, the cattle of Romulus and Remus one day going astray, they, praying to the god Faunus, ran out to seek them naked, wishing not to be troubled with sweat, and that this is why the Luperci run naked. If the sacrifice be by way of purification, a dog might very well be sacrificed, for the Greeks, in their illustrations, carry out young dogs, and frequently use this ceremony of periscylacismus, as they call it. Or if again it is a sacrifice of gratitude to the wolf that nourished and preserved Romulus, there is good reason in killing a dog, as being an enemy to wolves. Unless, indeed, after all, the creature is punished for hindering the Luperci in their running.  They say, too, Romulus was the first that consecrated holy fire, and instituted holy virgins to keep it, called vestals; others ascribe it to Numa Pompilius; agreeing, however, that Romulus was otherwise eminently religious, and skilled in divination, and for that reason carried the lituus, a crooked rod with which soothsayers describe the quarters of the heavens, when they sit to observe the flights of birds. This of his, being kept in the Palatium, was lost when the city was taken by the Gauls; and afterwards, that barbarous people being driven out, was found in the ruins, under a great heap of ashes, untouched by the fire, all things about it being consumed and burnt. He instituted also certain laws, one of which is somewhat severe, which suffers not a wife to leave her husband, but grants a husband power to turn off his wife, either upon poisoning her children or counterfeiting his keys, or for adultery; but if the husband upon any other occasion put her away, he ordered one moiety of his estate to be given to the wife, the other to fall to the goddess Ceres; and whoever cast off his wife, to make an atonement by sacrifice to the gods of the dead. This, too, is observable as a singular thing in Romulus, that he appointed no punishment for real parricide, but called all murder so, thinking the one an accursed thing, but the other a thing impossible; and, for a long time, his judgment seemed to have been right; for in almost six hundred years together, nobody committed the like in Rome; and Lucius Hostius, after the wars of Hannibal, is recorded to have been the first parricide. Let this much suffice concerning these matters.  In the fifth year of the reign of Tatius, some of his friends and kinsmen, meeting ambassadors coming from Laurentum to Rome, attempted on the road to take away their money by force, and, upon their resistance, killed them. So great a villainy having been committed Romulus thought the malefactors ought at once to be punished, but Tatius shuffled off and deferred the execution of it; and this one thing was the beginning of open quarrel betwixt them; in all other respects they were very careful of their conduct, and administered affairs together with great unanimity. The relations of the slain, being debarred of lawful satisfaction by reason of Tatius, fell upon him as he was sacrificing with Romulus at Lavinium and slew him; but escorted Romulus home, commending and extolling him for a just prince. Romulus took the body of Tatius, and buried it very splendidly in the Aventine Mount, near the place called Armilustrium, but altogether neglected revenging his murder. Some authors write, that the city of Laurentum, fearing the consequences, delivered up the murderers of Tatius; but Romulus dismissed them, saying one murder was requited with another. This gave occasion of talk and jealousy, as if he were well pleased at the removal of his co-partner in the government. Nothing of these things, however, raised any sort of feud or disturbance among the Sabines; but some out of love to him, others out of fear of his power, some again reverencing him as a god, they all continued living peacefully in admiration and awe of him; many foreign nations, too, showed respect to Romulus; the Ancient Latins sent and entered into league and confederacy with him. Fidenae he took, a neighbouring city to Rome, by a party of horse, as some say, whom he sent before with commands to cut down the hinges of the gates, himself afterwards unexpectedly coming up. Others say, they having first made the invasion, plundering and ravaging the country and suburbs, Romulus lay in ambush for them, and having killed many of their men, took the city; but, nevertheless, did not raze or demolish it, but made it a Roman colony, and sent thither, on the Ides of April, two thousand five hundred inhabitants.  Soon after a plague broke out, causing sudden death without any previous sickness; it infected also the corn with unfruitfulness, and cattle with barrenness; there rained blood, too, in the city; so that, to their actual sufferings, fear of the wrath of the gods was added. But when the same mischiefs fell upon Laurentum, then everybody judged it was divine vengeance that fell upon both cities, for the neglect of executing justice upon the murder of Tatius and the ambassadors. But the murderers or, both sides being delivered up and punished, the pestilence visibly abated; and Romulus purified the cities with lustrations, which, they say, even now, are performed at the wood called Ferentina. But before the plague ceased, the Camertines invaded the Romans and overran the country, thinking them, by reason of the distemper, unable to resist; but Romulus at once made head against them, and gained the victory, with the slaughter of six thousand men, then took their city, and brought half of those be found there to Rome, sending from Rome to Camerium double the number he left there. This was done on the first of August. So many citizens had he to spare, in sixteen years\' time from his first founding Rome. Among other spoils he took a brazen four-horse chariot from Camerium, which he placed in the temple of Vulcan, setting on it his own statue, with a figure of victory crowning him.  The Roman cause thus daily gathering strength, their weaker neighbours shrunk away, and were thankful to be left untouched; but the stronger, out of fear or envy, thought they ought not to give way to Romulus but to curb and put a stop to his growing greatness. The first were the Veientes, a people of Tuscany, who had large possessions, and dwelt in a spacious city; they took occasion to commence a war, by claiming Fidenae as belonging to them; a thing not only very unreasonable, but very ridiculous, that they, who did not assist them in the greatest extremities, but permitted them to be slain, should challenge their lands and houses when in the hands of others. But being scornfully retorted upon by Romulus in his answers, they divided themselves into two bodies; with one they attacked the garrison of Fidenae, the other marched against Romulus; that which went against Fidenae got the victory, and slew two thousand Romans; the other was worsted by Romulus, with the loss of eight thousand men. A fresh battle was fought near Fidenae, and here all men acknowledge the day\'s success to have been chiefly the work of Romulus himself, who showed the highest skill as well as courage, and seemed to manifest a strength and swiftness more than human. But what some write, that of fourteen thousand that fell that day, above half were slain by Romulus\'s own hand, verges too near to fable, and is, indeed, simply incredible; since even the Messenians are thought to go too far in saying that Aristomenes three times offered sacrifice for the death of a hundred enemies, Lacedaemonians, slain by himself. The army being thus routed, Romulus, suffering those that were left to make their escape, led his forces against the city; they, having suffered such great losses, did not venture to oppose, but, humbly suing to him, made a league and friendship for an hundred years; surrendering also a large district of land called Septempagium, that is, the seven parts, as also their salt-works upon the river, and fifty noblemen for hostages. He made his triumph for this on the Ides of October, leading, among the rest of his many captives, the general of the Veientes, an elderly man, but who had not, it seemed, acted with the prudence of age; whence even now, in sacrifices for victories, they lead an old man through the marketplace to the Capitol, apparelled in purple, with a bulla, or child\'s toy, tied to it, and the crier cries, Sardians to be sold; for the Tuscans are said to be a colony of the Sardians, and the Veientes are a city of Tuscany.  This was the last battle Romulus ever fought; afterwards he, as most, nay all men, very few excepted, do, who are raised by great and miraculous good-haps of fortune to power and greatness, so, I say, did he; relying upon his own great actions, and growing of an haughtier mind, he forsook his popular behaviour for kingly arrogance, odious to the people; to whom in particular the state which he assumed was hateful. For he dressed in scarlet, with the purple-bordered robe over it; he gave audience on a couch of state, having always about him some young men called Celeres, from their swiftness in doing commissions; there went before him others with staves, to make room, with leather thongs tied on their bodies, to bind on the moment whoever he commanded. The Latins formerly used ligare in the same sense as now alligare, to bind, whence the name lictors, for these officers, and bacula, or staves, for their rods, because staves were then used. It is probable, however, they were first called litores, afterwards, by putting in a c, lictores, or, in Greek, liturgi, or people\'s officers, for leitos is still Greek for the commons, and laos for the people in general.  But when, after the death of his grandfather Numitor in Alba, the throne devolving upon Romulus, he, to court the people, put the government into their own hands, and appointed an annual magistrate over the Albans, this taught the great men of Rome to seek after a free and anti-monarchical state, wherein all might in turn be subjects and rulers. For neither were the patricians any longer admitted to state affairs, only had the name and title left them, convening in council rather for fashion\'s sake than advice, where they heard in silence the king\'s commands, and so departed, exceeding the commonalty only in hearing first what was done. These and the like were matters of small moment; but when he of his own accord parted among his soldiers what lands were acquired by war, and restored the Veientes their hostages, the senate neither consenting nor approving of it, then, indeed, he seemed to put a great affront upon them; so that, on his sudden and strange disappearance a short while after, the senate fell under suspicion and calumny. He disappeared on the Nones of July, as they now call the month which was then Quintilis, leaving nothing of certainty to be related of his death; only the time, as just mentioned, for on that day many ceremonies are sill performed in representation of what happened. Neither is this uncertainty to be thought strange, seeing the manner of the death of Scipio Africanus, who died at his own home after supper, has been found capable neither of proof or disproof; for some say he died a natural death, being of a sickly habit; others that he poisoned himself; others again, that his enemies, breaking in upon him in the night stifled him. Yet Scipio\'s dead body lay open to be seen of all, and any one, from his own observation, might form his suspicions and conjectures, whereas Romulus, when he vanished, left neither the least part of his body, nor any remnant of his clothes to be seen. So that some fancied the senators, having fallen upon him in the temple of Vulcan, cut his body into pieces, and took each a part away in his bosom; others think his disappearance was neither in the temple of Vulcan, nor with the senators only by, but that it came to pass that, as he was haranguing the people without the city, near a place called the Goat\'s Marsh, on a sudden strange and unaccountable disorders and alterations took place in the air; the face of the sun was darkened, and the day turned into night, and that, too, no quiet, peaceable night, but with terrible thunderings, and boisterous winds from all quarters; during which the common people dispersed and fled, but the senators kept close together. The tempest being over and the light breaking out, when the people gathered again, they missed and inquired for their king; the senators suffered them not to search, or busy themselves about the matter, but commanded them to honour and worship Romulus as one taken up to the gods, and about to be to them, in the place of a good prince, now a propitious god. The multitude, hearing this, went away believing and rejoicing in hopes of good things from him; but there were some, who, canvassing the matter in a hostile temper, accused and aspersed the patricians, as men that persuaded the people to believe ridiculous tales, when they themselves were the murderers of the king.  Things being in this disorder, one, they say, of the patricians, of noble family and approved good character, and a faithful and familiar friend of Romulus himself, having come with him from Alba, Julius Proculus by name, presented himself in the forum; and, taking a most sacred oath, protested before them all, that, as he was travelling on the road, he had seen Romulus coming to meet him, looking taller and comelier than ever, dressed in shining and flaming armour; and he, being affrighted at the apparition, said, ""Why, O king, or for what purpose have you abandoned us to unjust and wicked surmises, and the whole city to bereavement and endless sorrow?"" and that he made answer, ""It pleased the gods, O Proculus, that we, who came from them, should remain so long a time amongst men as we did; and, having built a city to be the greatest in the world for empire and glory, should again return to heaven. But farewell; and tell the Romans, that, by the exercise of temperance and fortitude, they shall attain the height of human power; we will be to you the propitious god Quirinus."" This seemed credible to the Romans, upon the honesty and oath of the relater, and indeed, too, there mingled with it a certain divine passion, some preternatural influence similar to possession by a divinity; nobody contradicted it, but, laying aside all jealousies and detractions, they prayed to Quirinus and saluted him as a god.  This is like some of the Greek fables of Aristeas the Proconnesian, and Cleomedes the Astypalaean; for they say Aristeas died in a fuller\'s workshop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him travelling towards Croton. And that Cleomedes, being an extraordinarily strong and gigantic man, but also wild and mad, committed many desperate freaks; and at last, in a school-house, striking a pillar that sustained the roof with his fist, broke it in the middle, so that the house fell and destroyed the children in it; and being pursued, he fled into a great chest, and, shutting to the lid, held it so fast, that many men, with their united strength, could not force it open; afterwards, breaking the chest to pieces, they found no man in it alive or dead; in astonishment at which, they sent to consult the oracle at Delphi; to whom the prophetess made this answer,-  ""Of all the heroes, Cleomede is last.""  They say, too, the body of Alcmena, as they were carrying her to her grave, vanished, and a stone was found lying on the bier. And many such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures naturally mortal; for though altogether to disown a divine nature in human virtue were impious and base, so again, to mix heaven with earth is ridiculous. Let us believe with Pindar, that-  ""All human bodies yield to Death\'s decree, The soul survives to all eternity."" For that alone is derived from the gods, thence comes, and thither returns; not with the body, but when most disengaged and separated from it, and when most entirely pure and clean and free from the flesh: for the most perfect soul, says Heraclitus, is a dry light, which flies out of the body as lightning breaks from a cloud; but that which is clogged and surfeited with body is like gross and humid incense, slow to kindle and ascend. We must not, therefore, contrary to nature, send the bodies, too, of good men to heaven; but we must really believe that, according to their divine nature and law, their virtue and their souls are translated out of men into heroes, out of heroes into demi-gods, out of demi-gods, after passing, as in the rite of initiation, through a final cleansing and sanctification, and so freeing themselves from all that pertains to mortality and sense, are thus, not by human decree, but really and according to right reason, elevated into gods admitted thus to the greatest and most blessed perfection.  Romulus\'s surname Quirinus, some say, is equivalent to Mars; others, that he was so called because the citizens were called Quirites; others, because the ancients called a dart or spear Quiris; thus, the statue of Juno resting on a spear is called Quiritis, and the dart in the Regia is addressed as Mars, and those that were distinguished in war were usually presented with a dart; that, therefore, Romulus being a martial god, or a god of darts, was called Quirinus. A temple is certainly built to his honour on the mount called from him Quirinalis.  The day he vanished on is called the Flight of the People and the Nones of the Goats, because they go then out of the city and sacrifice at the Goat\'s Marsh, and, as they go, they shout out some of the Roman names, as Marcus, Lucius, Caius, imitating the way in which they then fled and called upon one another in that fright and hurry. Some, however, say this was not in imitation of a flight, but of a quick and hasty onset, referring it to the following occasion: After the Gauls who had taken Rome were driven out by Camillus, and the city was scarcely as yet recovering her strength, many of the Latins, under the command of Livius Postumius, took this time to march against her. Postumius, halting not far from Rome, sent a herald, signifying that the Latins were desirous to renew their former alliance and affinity (that was now almost decayed) by contracting new marriages between both nations; if, therefore, they would send forth a good number of their virgins and widows, they should have peace and friendship, such as the Sabines had formerly had on the like conditions. The Romans, hearing this, dreaded a war, yet thought a surrender of their women little better than mere captivity. Being in this doubt, a servant-maid called Philotis (or, as some say, Tutola), advised them to do neither, but, by a stratagem, avoid both fighting and the giving up of such pledges. The stratagem was this, that they should send herself, with other welllooking servant-maids, to the enemy, in the dress of free-born virgins, and she should in the night light up a fire signal, at which the Romans should come armed and surprise them asleep. The Latins were thus deceived, and accordingly Philotis set up a torch in a wild fig-tree, screening it behind with curtains and coverlets from the sight of the enemy, while visible to the Romans. They, when they saw it, eagerly ran out of the gates, calling in their haste to each other as they went out, and so, falling in unexpectedly upon the enemy, they defeated them, and upon that made a feast of triumph, called the Nones of the Goats, because of the wild fig-tree, called by the Romans Caprificus, or the goat-fig. They feast the women without the city in arbours made of fig-tree boughs, and the maid-servants gather together and run about playing; afterwards they fight in sport, and throw stones one at another, in memory that they then aided and assisted the Roman men in fight. This only a few authors admit for true; for the calling upon one another\'s names by day and the going out to the Goat\'s Marsh to do sacrifice seem to agree more with the former story, unless, indeed, we shall say that both the actions might have happened on the same day in different years. It was in the fifty-fourth year of his age and the thirty-eighth of his reign that Romulus, they tell us, left the world.', ' I\'m not afraid (I\'m not afraid) To take a stand (To take a stand) Everybody (Everybody) Come take my hand (Come take my hand) We\'ll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just lettin\' you know that you\'re not alone Holla if you feel like you\'ve been down the same road   Yeah, it\'s been a ride I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one Now some of you might still be in that place If you\'re tryna get out, just follow me I\'ll get you there   You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay \'em But you won\'t take the sting out these words before I say \'em \'Cause ain\'t no way I\'ma let you stop me from causin\' mayhem When I say I\'ma do somethin\', I do it I don\'t give a damn what you think, I\'m doin\' this for me So fuck the world, feed it beans It\'s gassed up if it thinks it\'s stoppin\' me I\'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably And all those who look down on me I\'m tearin\' down your balcony No ifs, ands or buts, don\'t try to ask him why or how can he From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he\'s still shittin\' Whether he\'s on salary, paid hourly Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him Whichever comes first, for better or worse He\'s married to the game Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse Forget the Earth, he\'s got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt And fuck the whole universe   I\'m not afraid (I\'m not afraid) To take a stand (To take a stand) Everybody (Everybody) Come take my hand (Come take my hand) We\'ll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just lettin\' you know that you\'re not alone Holla if you feel like you\'ve been down the same road   Okay, quit playin\' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap I shouldn\'t have to rhyme these words in a rhythm For you to know it\'s a rap You said you was king, you lied through your teeth For that, fuck your feelings Instead of gettin\' crowned, you\'re gettin\' capped And to the fans, I\'ll never let you down again, I\'m back I promise to never go back on that promise In fact, let\'s be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh"" Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground Relax, I ain\'t goin\' back to that now All I\'m tryin\' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow \'Cause I ain\'t playin\' around There\'s a game called circle and I don\'t know how I\'m way too up to back down But I think I\'m still tryin\' to figure this crap out Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn\'t This fuckin\' black cloud still follows me around But it\'s time to exorcise these demons These muh\'fuckers are doin\' jumpin\' jacks now   I\'m not afraid (I\'m not afraid) To take a stand (To take a stand) Everybody (Everybody) Come take my hand (Come take my hand) We\'ll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just lettin\' you know that you\'re not alone Holla if you feel like you\'ve been down the same road   And I just can\'t keep livin\' this way So startin\' today I\'m breakin\' out of this cage I\'m standin\' up, I\'ma face my demons I\'m mannin\' up, I\'ma hold my ground I\'ve had enough, now I\'m so fed up Time to put my life back together right now   It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you So I could come back a brand-new me You helped see me through And don\'t even realize what you did, believe me you I\'ve been through the wringer But they can do little to the middle finger I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers And drop dead: no more beef lingers No more drama from now on, I promise To focus solely on handlin\' my responsibilities as a father So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters And raise it, you couldn\'t lift a single shingle on it \'Cause the way I feel, I\'m strong enough to go to the club Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up \'Cause I\'m raisin\' the bar I\'d shoot for the moon, but I\'m too busy gazin\' at stars I feel amazin\', and I\'m—   I\'m not afraid (I\'m not afraid) To take a stand (To take a stand) Everybody (Everybody) Come take my hand (Come take my hand) We\'ll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just lettin\' you know that you\'re not alone Holla if you feel like you\'ve been down the same road', ' Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Brzeczek further informed Daley that he would not initiate a criminal investigation into the allegations that Wilson was tortured unless Daley authorized such an investigation. Id.  4. Daley never authorized a criminal investigation, and the Chicago Police Department therefore did not initiate a criminal investigation into Wilson’s allegations, and on May 19, 1983, Daley honored Burge and four other Area 2 detectives for their work in the Wilson case” Brzeczek Dep., Wilson v. City of Chicago, pp 123-24; Brzeczek Affidavit; Chicago Tribune, 5/20/83, “Daley Hails 11 in Crime War.”  5. The Chicago Police Department never investigated numerous allegations of police torture and abuse which arose from the manhunt to find and arrest Andrew Wilson and which were lodged with its IAD and OPS in February of 1982. Wilson v. City of Chicago, 6 F3d 1230 (7th Cir. 1993).  6. On November 12, 1982, Andrew Wilson testified at his motion to suppress hearing that he was tortured by Jon Burge, John Yucaitis, and other Area 2 detectives by electric shock, bagging, beating and burning on a radiator. People v. Wilson. 2  7. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin, judicially admitted that: At the hearing, Andrew Wilson will testify that on February 14, 1982, he was arrested at an apartment by several officers, including respondents Burge and Yucaitis. As Wilson was being taken to the car to be transported to Area II, he heard Burge telling the transporting officers not to “mess with” Wilson and that they would deal with him when they arrived at the station. Wilson was then taken to Area II by Yucaitis and three other officers. Transcript of Testimony of Andrew Wilson, July 7, 10, 11, 1989, at 2914-31 When they arrived at Area II, Wilson was taken to a room where the four transporting officers, including Yucaitis, and other officers started beating him. They hit him, kicked him, knocked him down and slammed him into a window so hard that it broke. In addition, one of the officers grabbed a plastic garbage bag and put it over Wilson’s head, holding it around his neck so that he could not breathe. The officers took the bag off when Wilson bit a hole in it. The officers stopped beating Wilson when Burge entered the room and stated that if it had been him, he would not have left any marks on Wilson. Tr. at 2932-36 Wilson was taken to a second room and handcuffed to the wall. Yucaitis then took Wilson to a telephone and told him to call his brother. When Wilson replied that he did not want to talk but wanted a lawyer, he was taken back to the second room again handcuffed to the wall. Tr. At 2937-44. Burge entered the room and told Wilson he was going to make a statement because Burge’s reputation was at stake. Burge left the room and Yucaitis came in with a brown paper bag. Yucaitis opened the bag and took out a black box about 12-14 inches long, 8-9 inches wide and 6 ½-7 inches high. The box had a crank and two wires with clamps. Yucaitis squatted down in front of Wilson with the box between his own legs, and put one clamp in Wilson’s nose and one on Wilson’s ears, and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s teeth to grind and was so painful that he kicked Yucaitis. Yucaitis punched him in the mouth and cranked the box again. Yucaitis left the room and then returned, put the black box in the bag, and left again. Tr. at 2947-55. Respondent O’Hara then came in and took Wilson to see the Assistant State’s Attorney, Lawrence Hyman. According to Wilson’s testimony, with O’Hara present, Wilson asked Hyman, “You want me to make a statement after they’ve been torturing me?” O’Hara took Wilson back to the second room. Tr. at 2956-59. Burge later returned to the second room with the brown paper bag and said, “Fun time.” Burge put a pair of handcuffs on Wilson’s other arm and another pair on Wilson’s 3 ankles. He then placed the bag in the garbage can and left. He returned, took out the black box, put the clamps on Wilson’s ears and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s to grind his teeth and knocked Wilson out of his chair. Wilson kept rubbing the clips from the electrical device off his ears. Tr at 2961-63. Wilson was then handcuffed across the radiator, kneeling with his arms outstretched. Burge and another officer put the clamps on Wilson’s little fingers and cranked the box repeatedly this time for longer periods. As he was being shocked, Wilson’s chest, leg and face were forced against the radiator and he was burned. Tr. at 2963-66 When Burge stopped cranking and took the clamps off Wilson’s little fingers, he took another shocking device out of the bag. It plugged into an electrical outlet and had a cord sticking out of it. Burge placed the device very near Wilson’s skin so that he could feel it tingling. Burge then jabbed the second device into Wilson’s back and Wilson got a full jolt, slamming Wilson into the grill on the window. Wilson began spitting out blood. Burge and the other officer put the devices back in the bag and left. Tr. at 296-68. A while later, Wilson was taken to Area I headquarters for a lineup. At Area I, Burge stuck his gun in Wilson’s mouth and cocked it back and forth. When Wilson arrived back at Area II after the lineup, Burge told him that if he did not make a statement, he would shock him again. Later, Burge told Wilson he was going to “fry his black ass.” Tr. at 2969-75. Memorandum In Opposition, pp.4-6.  8. In February of 1992, Andrew Wilson testified before the Police Board on behalf of the City in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, and described his torture in a manner consistent with how the City described it in its January 22, 1992 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, at pp. 4-6; Police Board Testimony of Andrew Wilson.  9. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, the City of Chicago, who was a Defendant in that case, admitted in its Amended Answer, dated July 13, 1995, that Andrew Wilson was tortured by Jon Burge on February 14, 1982.  10. Melvin Jones testified on August 5, 1982 at his motion to suppress hearing that he was arrested and transported to Area 2 at 92nd and Cottage Grove on February 5, 1982, and 4 placed in an interview room. People v. Melvin Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 61-62.  11. Melvin Jones testified that while being held in an interview room and interrogated, Lieutenant Jon Burge pulled up a chair and sat in front of Jones who was cuffed to the wall, that Burge had a little wooden box with a long cord, that Burge pulled down Jones’ pants to his ankles and electrically shocked Jones on his foot, then on his thigh and then on his penis. Jones testified that he kept hollering and telling Burge that he wasn’t supposed to do this to him, that Burge said to him that he had no proof, that Burge asked detective Flood, who was present for the shocking, if he saw anything and Flood looked at the ceiling and said no. Jones further stated that Burge said, “o court and no State are going to take your word against a Lieutenant’s word,” and Burge later hit him in the head with a stapler. People v. Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 65-71, 74.  12. Melvin Jones further testified that on February 6, 1982, while he was still being detained in an Area 2 interview room, Defendant McWeeny entered the room with another detective and questioned Jones, after which Lieutenant Burge entered the room and asked McWeeny if Jones had started talking yet. Jones further stated that when McWeeny said Jones hadn’t said anything yet, Burge pulled out a gun and cocked it, put it up to Jones’ head and said he was going to “blow Jones’ black head off.” Id. pp. 76-79.  13. Melvin Jones testified on February 19, 1992 on behalf of the City at the Chicago Police Board Hearing, that McWeeny told Burge to get out of the room and McWeeny stated to him later that evening that he  “had got the Lieutenant off me for right now. He said, if you are going to talk, you know, it would be easier for me.” Id. at 79; Chicago Police Board, 2/19/92, p. 856.  14. Cassandra Watson, Melvin Jones’ attorney in 1982, testified at the Chicago Police 5 Board Hearings on 2/19/92 that Jones told her within the first 10 days of February, 1982 that he had been beaten and threatened at Area 2, that while he was in an interview room at Area 2 a gun had been placed to his head, and that Lieutenant Burge had electrically shocked him with an electrical shock box. Chicago Police Board Proceedings, 2/19/92, pp. 960-62.  15. Jones testified on behalf of the City in the Police Board proceedings against Burge, and again identified Burge as the person who tortured him. Id., p. 826).  16. In their Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: Melvin Jones will testify that on February 5, 1982, just nine days prior to Andrew Wilson’s arrest, he was taken to an Area II interrogation room where he was handcuffed and questioned by Area II detectives concerning his knowledge and participation in a murder. When he failed to give information implicating himself in the murder, respondent Burge entered the room and told Jones that he was going to talk. Burge then asked Jones if he had ever heard of him, and when Jones replied that he had not, Burge told him that before he left the station Jones would “wish he had never set eyes on him.” Burge left the interrogation room but returned after Jones persisted in his refusal to talk to the interrogating detectives. Burge had Jones cuffed to a second ring and then produced and plugged into the wall socket a wooden box measuring approximately 10"" x 6"" x 6"", with tweezers and a long nail type device. He again asked Jones if he was going to talk. When Jones again refused, Burge pulled down Jones’ pants and shorts and, using the electrical device, shocked Jones three times, on the foot, thigh, and penis. While he was shocking Jones, Burge demanded that Jones talk. He told Jones that he had also shocked “Satan” (Anthony Holmes) and “Cochise,” forcing them to crawl all over the floor. He also told Jones that nobody would believe his word against a lieutenant’s. Burge asked another Area II detective present in the room if he had seen anything, and the detective looked at the ceiling and said no. Burge also tied a sock in Jones’ mouth. Burge was interrupted in his interrogation of Jones, apparently by the news that a policeman had been shot and killed on a bus in his area. Later, Burge also struck Jones with a stapler. When Jones continued to deny knowing anything about the murder, Burge again entered the interrogation room. He pointed a gun at Jones’ head, cocked it and told Jones he was going to “blow his black head off.” 6 City and Martin’s Memorandum In Opposition, pp. 7-8.  17. On May 15, 1995, the City of Chicago admitted that Melvin Jones had been electrically shocked by Jon Burge on his genitals and thigh with a device in a wooden box and threatened with a gun, while he was handcuffed to a ring in the wall in an Area 2 interview room in an attempt to coerce a confession from him.

During Fogel’s July 26, 1989 deposition, a lawyer for Andrew Wilson, who was conducting the deposition, requested production of Fogel’s file.  55. Lawyers for the City of Chicago refused to produce this file. 13  56. At the Chicago City Council Police Torture Hearings, held on December 24, 1990, counsel for Andrew Wilson publicly informed the members of the committee conducting the Hearings about Mr. Fogel’s electric shock file, and requested that the Committee conducting the Hearings obtain these documents. City Council Hearing, 12/24/90, p. 36.  57. Neither this file nor the documents contained therein were produced by the City, the Police Department, or the OPS to the City Council or the Committee hearing the torture allegations, nor did the City Council nor the Committee obtained the file or the documents contained therein.  58.

On or about May 16, 1996, the City, through Assistant Corporation Counsel Carey, formally responded by letter to the request for compliance concerning the Fogel File as follows: “I am attempting to see if, in fact, your assertions are correct as to whether David Fogel left these materials at OPS. If you have any information concerning how you know he left the records at OPS, it might assist the City in locating any such files. Once I have received this information, I will let you know what the City can or cannot produce.”  64. On or about May 23, 1996, in another letter to the City seeking compliance with Request # 11, Plaintiff Wiggins, through counsel, stated: “Former OPS Director Fogel testified that he left these documents in his file at OPS when he left at a deposition taken in Fallon and incorporated in this and other Monell cases on September 24, 1992, at pages 637-8.

In 1988, shortly after shortly after Leroy Martin became Superintendent, he transferred Burge from his post as Commander of the Bomb and Arson Unit back to the Detective Division as Commander of Area 3.  71. Also in 1988, Burge requested that Martin intervene with the City Council Finance Committee to obtain private council at the City’s expense to represent him in the Wilson civil trial, and Martin conveyed his request.

After Martin transferred Burge to Area 3, key members of Burge’s torture squad - - -including Sergeant Byrne, and Detectives Paladino, Maslanka and Mc Weeny - - - also transferred to Area 3 and allegations of torture began to proliferate there. Plaintiff’s Listing of Known Burge, Area 2 and 3 Torture Victims, 1972-1991.  74. From 1981, when State’s Attorney Daley assumed office, until the end of 1988, when he left office to run for Mayor, approximately 55 victims had alleged torture at Area 2, many allegedly tortured statements had been taken by his assistants, and many motions to suppress where Area 2 torture was alleged had been defended by his office, yet neither Daley nor the SAO initiated any investigations or brought any criminal charges against Burge or any of his men. Id.  75. On July 26, 1989, Mary Powers on behalf of Citizens Alert and several other community groups wrote to OPS Director David Fogel requesting that OPS “reopen an investigation into torture and other abuses by commander Jon Burge,” and that he “support our recommendation that the Chicago Police Board conduct open public hearings into patterns of torture by some members of the Chicago Police Department dating back at least 16 years.” Powers Letter of 7/26/89.  76. In the Powers letter of July 26, 1989, she specifically cited the allegations made by Melvin Jones that he was electric shocked and otherwise abused in February of 1982. Id. 17  77. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Melvin Jones’ allegations of torture in response to this letter or at any other time.  78. On August 17, 1989, Mary Powers, and other community activists appeared before the Police Board and, in Superintendent Martin”s presence, detailed evidence of a pattern of torture at Area 2 which had come out in the Wilson civil trials, including a description of the torture device, and the finding by the Wilson Jury that there was a pattern and practice of abuse at Area 2, and demanded that a broad investigation be conducted, and that Burge be suspended pending the results of the investigation. Police Board Proceedings, 8/17/89.  79. On September 14, 1989, Mary Powers, and other community activists again appeared before the Police Board and, in Superintendent Martin”s presence, again raised the torture evidence and the demand that Burge be fired. Superintendent Martin responded by stating: “Commander Burge is working, as far as I know, he’ll be working Ms. Powers. I have no reason to suspend Commander Burge. You want him suspended. I have no reason to suspend him at this time.” Police Board Proceedings, 9/14/89, pp. 90-91.  80. In September and October of 1989, the City Council held several days of Hearings into police brutality and torture, at which Mayor Daley gave a statement, and Superintendent Martin and OPS Director Fogel attended and testified. City Council Hearings, September 28-; October 6, 10, 11 1989.  81. Mayor Daley made the following statement to the Committee at the Hearings: “Superintendent Leroy Martin was . . . reappointed by me. He has complete responsibility over the Chicago Police Department. I have full confidence in his administration. He has done an outstanding job.” City Council Hearing, 9/28/89, p. 4.  82. At the hearing, torture at Area 2 was presented through the testimony of Stanley Howard’s mother, OPS Director Fogel was questioned about Burge, electric shock, and 18 baggings at Area 2, Martin was also asked about Howard’s torture, and he promised to look into it. Hearing, 9/29/89, pp 172-215, 10/6/89, pp. 187-96, and 10/10/89, pp. 392-400.  83. On November 30, 1989, Mary Powers, and other community activists again appeared before the Police Board and, in Superintendent Martin’s presence, again raised the torture evidence and the demand that Burge be fired. Superintendent Martin responded by stating: that he wished the activists would follow up on cases where police officers are shot “the way you are following up on the Burge case and see to it that justice is done to the person who took my officer’s life.” Police Board Proceedings, 11/30/89, pp. 19-25.  84. On December 24, 1990, the City Council held Christmas Eve hearings, chaired by Finance Committee Chairman Ed Burke, on the question of police torture at Area 2 during which several witnesses presented numerous allegations of police torture at Area 2. City Council. Hearing, 12/24/90.  85. At the Chicago City Council Hearings held in December 24, 1990, counsel for Andrew Wilson tendered the Committee and its counsel, a 21 page document entitled “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His Men.”  86. The “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His Men” which was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to the Committee and its counsel at the Chicago City Council Hearings held on December 24, 1990, listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange.  87. At the Christmas Eve hearing, evidence that SA Daley refused to investigate when requested to do so by Superintendent Brzeczek. was presented, and Daley responded publicly, with his office stating that “Andrew Wilson refused to testify before the grand jury about the 19 allegations.” Chicago Tribune, 12/25/90, “Hearing Examines Brutality Charges;” Chicago Sun Times, 12/25/90, “Davis Urges New Review of Police Brutality Cases.”  88. The “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His Men” which listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange, was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to Superintendent Leroy Martin on or about December 19, 1990.  89. In a letter dated January 9, 1991, OPS Director Gayle Shines wrote to counsel for Andrew Wilson that “Superintendent Martin has referred to me your letter of 19 December and the attached Fact Sheet.”  90. The City Council or its Finance committee never issued a report or took any other action after the December 24th torture hearings.  91. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International issued a Report calling for “a full inquiry into allegations that Chicago police systematically tortured criminal suspects from 1972 to 1984,” and in response, the spokesman for Mayor Daley said she had “‘no comment whatsoever.’” Chicago Sun Times, 1/28/91, “Police Torture Probe Sought Here.”  92. On or about November 2, 1990 OPS Director Gayle Shines approved as “compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 25 page Report and findings made by OPS investigator Michael Goldston concerning allegations of torture and abuse at Area 2. This Report included the following findings: As to the matter of alleged physical abuse, the preponderance of the evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic. The time span involved covers more than ten years. The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture. The evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to Area 2 engaged in methodical abuse. 20 The number of incidents in which an Area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion. Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end. This conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which Area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse. OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings, and Cover Letter, Shines to Martin, dated November 2, 1990 (Goldston Report).  93. In her forwarding memo of November 2, 1990, OPS Director Shines, while approving the conclusions of Goldston and Sanders, further informed Superintendent Martin that they both did “a masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling.” 11/2/90 Cover Memo, Shines to Martin, with OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings enclosed.  94. On or about November 2, 1990, OPS Director Gayle Shines approved “as compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 66 page report and conclusions of OPS investigator Francine Sanders which found that based on “the overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations” that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against Jon Burge and John Yucaitis including that they “repeatedly administered electrical stimulation to Mr  Wilson’s body in order to create pain” and that Burge “held Mr. Wilson, while handcuffed, against a hot radiator causing burns to Mr. Wilson’s face, chest and thigh.” Chicago Police Office of Professional Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), pp.62-66.  95. Martin acknowledged the “ serious nature” of Goldston’s conclusions Martin memo to Shines, 11/18/90.  96. At no time from receiving the Goldston Report in November of 1990 until he left 21 office in April of 1992, did Martin, OPS Director Shines, or any other City policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the Goldston report.  97. Instead, Martin, after waiting three months, wrote Shines seeking “further clarification” concerning the Goldston and Sanders Reports. Memo, Martin to Shines, 2/6/91.  98. Despite all of the torture evidence contained in the Goldston and Sanders Reports, in the Fact Sheet, and that was previously presented to Martin and the City Council, the City and Martin did not seek the prosecution of Burge and his confederates in the Wilson case, for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the Goldston report, or to prosecute Burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the evidence presented, including the Patterson and Madison Hobley cases.  99. In her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Martin, Shines supplied the “clarifications” sought by Martin, and informed him that the OPS findings “reflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation.” Shines memo, 4/30/91.  100. With her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Superintendent Martin, OPS Director Shines included investigator Goldston’s clarification memo, in which Goldston set forth that his investigation established that Area 2 detectives and supervisors Jon Burge, John Byrne, Peter Dignan, Charles Grunhard, John Yucaitis, Thomas McKenna, and Patrick O’Hara were “players” whose names “repeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse.” Goldston Memo of 4/30/91, attached to Shines Memo to Martin of the same date.  101. After waiting an additional seven months, in November of 1991, Superintendent Leroy Martin approved the findings set forth in the Chicago Police Office of Professional 22 Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, dated October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), Burge and Yucaitis were administratively charged by the CPD for abusing Andrew Wilson in the manner found in the Report, and separation proceedings were initiated before the Chicago Police Board. Cr 123543 (reopened).  102. However, after secret communications with Corporation Counsel Kelly Welch, which the City still refuses to produce, Martin refused to accept or adopt the Goldston findings, open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of Area 2 torture, to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture, or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers, but rather contacted the Police Foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by Goldston in arriving at his findings. Martin Letter to Williams, 11/8/91; City Privilege Log.  103. During this time period, community groups, including Citizen’s Alert, by letters and in face to face meetings, were demanding that Martin release the results of the OPS investigation into torture at Area 2. Powers Letter to Martin, 8/14/91.  104. Instead, Martin, through his lawyers at the Corporation Counsel’s Office, fought production and public release of the Goldston Report and its findings. See, generally, proceedings in Fallon v. Dillon, 90 C 6722.  105. In November of 1991, after Defendant Martin and Corporation Counsel Kelly Welsh had initiated proceedings before the Police Board to fire Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara for torturing Andrew Wilson, Mayor Daley “defended his decision not to take action against the officers when he was state’s attorney in 1982, explaining that . .  refused to cooperate with his office at that time.” Chicago Tribune, 11/26/91 “3 Cops Face Hearing in Torture Case.” 23  106. On or about February 7, 1992, the Goldston and Sanders were publicly released, over the City’s strenuous objection, pursuant to the order of Judge Milton Shadur in the case of Fallon v. Dillon, #90-C-6722.  107. In an article which appeared in the February 8, 1992 Chicago Tribune, Superintendent Leroy Martin, whgo was one of the previous Area 2 Commanders, was quoted as saying that it was an “outright lie” that Area 2 commanders knew about or condoned torture. Chicago Tribune, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged,” February 8, 1992.  108. In the same article, Mayor Richard M. Daley was quoted as saying of the Report, “these are only allegations . . . not substantiated cases,” as defending Martin’s suppression of the report, stating: “it’s allegations, rumors, stories, things like that” and of denying that the torture at Area 2 was “systematic.” Chicago Tribune, 2/8/92, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged;” Los Angeles Times, 2/8/92, “Chicago Police Used Torture Report Says,”  109. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the following judicial admission concerning the testimony of “seven additional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters:” The testimony regarding similar acts sets forth detailed accounts of tortuous treatment that are almost identical to the torture suffered by Andrew Wilson. The testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents  to torture certain suspects, often with substantial criminal records, into confessing to crimes or to condone such activity. 24 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, p. 1.  110. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, identified the “seven additional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters” as Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree. Id., pp. 7- 14. 111. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission - - - that the similar acts testimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects to elicit statements. Respondents  methods of torture through electric shock, bagging, and holding a gun to a suspect’s head are more that sufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes. In addition, the testimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways to elicit confessions to violent crimes. Id. p. 17. 112. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree: clearly establishes respondents’  motive and intent in torturing or condoning the torture of Wilson. Respondents generally engaged in these similar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime. Id. p. 22. 25 113. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree: shows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at Area II, prior to and subsequent to Wilson’s arrest, and Burge’s possession of and familiarity with the use of the devices. It is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the bagging technique, about which respondents deny knowing, and the technique of putting a gun to the head of a victim. Id., p. 24. 114. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission: There is no question that the similarities between  Wilson’s testimony and the similar victims’ testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard. Burge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases, and, when he was not the principal, he was still involved. In the case of all but one of the victims, the victim was picked up and taken to Area II where he was then interrogated regarding his knowledge or involvement in a serious offense. Although Donald White was taken instead to Area I, he was taken there and interrogated by Area II detectives. All of the victims were black and generally had significant criminal histories. Also similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with consequences if they refused to make a statement. After an initial refusal, the punishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the refusals to speak persisted. The most striking similarities, however, are found in the methods of torture used on the suspects. Wilson was electro shocked by Yucaitis using the black box and by Burge who used the black box and a curling-iron looking device, was “bagged” and beaten, and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth. Jones, Holmes, Poree, Powell and Orange were similarly electro shocked by Burge. Holmes, Powell, White and Mumin were all “bagged” and beaten to the point where they lost or almost lost consciousness. Burge pointed a cocked gun at Jones’s head, hit Poree in the head with a pistol, and placed a revolver containing one bullet at Mumin’s head and snapped it three times slowly. White had a gun placed in his mouth. Additionally, each of the victims was slapped around and punched. Burge’s statements to the victims were also very similar. Burge told both Jones and Mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his. As he did in relation to Wilson, he referred to the absence of marks on Mumin’s body. He said “fun time” as 26 he approached Wilson and Poree with the black box, and laughed when he bagged Mumin. He told Wilson he would “fry his black ass” and Jones he would “blow his black head off.” As the case law cited above aptly demonstrates, these actions or the condoning of these actions are overwhelming in their similarity. Id., pp. 25-26. 115. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the following judicial admission: Given the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the similar victims will testify, there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time to be relevant to this case. Tak the offenses in sequence, they reveal a pattern of almost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes. While the sequence spans twelve years, each offense is close enough to the next to connect it to the relevant pattern of behavior. Moreover, Melvin Jones’ and Donald White’s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before Andrew Wilson was tortured. Id., p. 28. 116. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted: Indeed, as the testimony of the similar victims shows, respondents  counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict when they persisted in their pattern of torture. Id., p. 28. 117. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, Jon Burge, Patrick O’Hara and John Yucaitis, 86-C-2360, entitled “City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission: Plaintiff Andrew Wilson has testified that he was beaten, kicked, punched, burned by being harnessed to a radiator, and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands, face, ears, and 27 between his legs by defendant police officers. Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that this outrageous conduct, unsanctioned and condemned by the City, and for which defendant officers were fired and/or disciplined, was within the defendants’ scope of employment. City Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 1. 118. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, entitled “City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission: The instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant officers were not in the scope of their employment. Plaintiff has failed to furnish any evidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him - - -the black box device and the modified curling iron - - were furnished by the City. Id., p. 17. 119. In its Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the judicial admission that Burge “cruelly torture” Andrew Wilson and “denie him necessary medical assistance.” Id., p. 19. 120. In this Memorandum, the City, through its lawyers, made the following admission concerning it change of position from defending Burge for his alleged torture of Andrew Wilson to asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of Burge’s employment: “The change in the City’s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the City in good faith and in the public interest.” Id. p. 12. 121. On July 30, 1992, almost two years after Superintendent Martin had first received the Goldston findings, the Police Foundation submitted its report to Superintendent of Police Matt Rodriguez. After noting that because “hangings, shockings, ‘baggings’ beatings, chokings, and beatings were alleged to occur, many in the Area 2 Headquarters itself, a thorough and rigorous investigation seemed required,” and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture alleged had in fact took place, the Report criticized Goldston’s methodology. Police Foundation 28 Report, “An Analysis of the Methods Employed in the Preparation of the Goldston Report,” 7/30/92. 122. The Police Foundation recommended, inter alia, that the Chicago Police Department investigate or re-investigate cases of serious misconduct listed in the Goldston Report, create a database concerning these investigations, rigorously and uniformly investigate them, and create a monitoring system to identify patterns of serious police misconduct. Id. 123. Almost three years after first receiving the Goldston Report, OPS Director Shines reopened the Cannon, Howard, Adkins, Craft, Holmes, White and Michael Johnson cases and assigned OPS investigators to them. Numerous other serious Area 2 torture cases, including those of Plaintiff, Leroy Orange, Melvin Jones, Anthony Homes, George Powell, and Madison Hobley, were not opened or reopened. Shines’ Dep. in Santiago v. Marquez; CRs of named Victims. 124. Leroy Orange testified on May 22,1985, at his trial that on January 12, 1984 he was taken to Area 2 and interrogated. During this interrogation, he was handcuffed behind his back to a circle in the wall, a plastic bag was put over his head, and when the bag was put over his head a second time he was punched in the stomach. People v. Orange, 5/22/85, pp. 1112-14. 125. Leroy Orange further testified that he was shocked on the arm with an electrical device, and that an officer stuck his hands between his legs and squeezed his testicles. Id. at 1114; Affidavits of Leroy Orange. 126. Leroy Orange averred in ¶¶ 11-13 of an affidavit that he was interviewed in the summer of 1990 by a male OPS investigator at Pontiac Correctional Center, and after reviewing a stack of photographs, he identified Jon Burge as one of the detectives involved in his torture. 29 127. OPS Investigator Michael Goldston listed Orange as a victim tortured by Burge in his 1990 OPS report. Goldston Report. 128. Detectives McWeeny and Madigan testified at Orange’s trial that they were partners and they arrested Orange on January 12, 1984, and they transported him to Area 2 Headquarters where they locked him in an interview room, and the next day they conducted lineups with him. People v. Orange, pp. 615-17, 624,1232-34. 129. Leroy Orange stated at his bond hearing on January 14, 1984 that he had pin marks on his butt, that was the only visible bruise he had to show, and that “other things happened.” People v. Orange, Kidd, 1/14/84, p. 3. 130. Orange’s co-defendant, Leonard Kidd, also stated at the January 14th bond hearing that he was hurting between his legs where the police jumped on him, and his lawyer also noted on the record that Kidd was limping and that he came in injured. Id. 131. On February 9, 1984, Orange’s attorney told a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times that officers administered electrical shocks to Orange’s buttocks and anus with a “black box.” “Cop ‘black box’ torture charged,” Chicago Sun Times, 2/9/84. 132. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: In January of 1984, Leroy Orange was taken to Area II where he was interrogated and tortured while Burge was in the room. Orange was shocked and jolted repeatedly with a black box plugged into the wall. Orange’s pants were pulled down while electroshock was applied to his body, including his buttocks. He was then asked if he was ready to make a statement, and he replied that he was. Orange reported this torture to his attorney, Earl Washington, who reported it to the media.. Memorandum In Opposition, January 22, 1992, p. 13. 133. In February of 1984, the OPS registered a complaint, number 136454, alleging that 30 Jon Burge and others who allegedly tortured Leroy Orange on January 12 and 13, 1984. 134. The OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a statement from Orange, Burge or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor. 135. The Chicago Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint number 136454. 136. On or about September 24, 1979, the OPS registered complaint number 108817 alleging that George Powell was beaten and suffocated with a bag while being questioned at Area 2, the OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a statement from Powell, Burge, or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor, and the Chicago Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint number 108817. 137. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: On September 20, 1979, George Powell was arrested at his girlfriend’s house and taken to Area II where he was handcuffed to a wall. Burge brought in a long object with a cord, similar to a cattle prod, and said he was go to do to Powell what he had done to “Satan.” Burge shocked Powell on his stomach and chest, such that Powell almost passed out. Also, while slapping ans questioning Powell, Burge put a bag over Powell’s head and Powell had to bite a hole in it in order to breathe. Powell’s mother filed a complaint with the office of Professional standards, who ultimately made a finding of not sustained. Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick o’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, p. 9. 138. In a statement taken on June 14, 2004, George Powell stated that he was electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic bag, and beaten by Jon Burge and other Area 2 detectives during his interrogation in September of 1999. 31 139. On May 11, 1989, Andrew Wilson\'s lawyers in Wilson’s civil rights trial filed ""Plaintiff\'s Proffer of Other Acts of Beating, Torture and Electroshock By Defendant Burge and Other Detectives."" and served it on the City through counsel. 140. “Plaintiff’s Proffer “listed 19 alleged victims of Burge, Sergeant Byrne, and their fellow Area 2 detectives. 141. “Plaintiff’s Proffer” listed Anthony “Satan” Holmes, stating: Anthony Holmes, nicknamed “Satan, ” was taken to Area II headquarters at approximately 4:00 a.m. Jon Burge presided over his interrogation, during which, in an effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were put over his head, causing him to pass out three separate times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock device, housed in a black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock, and causing him to fall out of his chair and roll on the floor. 142. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted: On May 30, 1973, at approximately 4:00 a.m., Anthony Holmes, whose street name is “Satan,” was taken to Area II headquarters where he was held, interrogated and tortured for approximately six hours. Respondent Burge presided over his interrogation, during which, in an effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were placed over Holmes’ head, causing him to pass out three times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock device, housed in a black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock, which caused him to fall out of his chair and roll on the floor. The shock was extremely painful and caused Holmes to press his jaws together and grit his teeth. Memorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992, p. 9. 143. On April 19, 2004 Anthony Holmes gave a Court reported statement in which he described the allegations made in Plaintiff’s Proffer in even greater detail. 144. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Anthony Holmes’ allegations in response Plaintiff Wilson’s Proffer, in response to the City’s statements in their January 22, 1992 Memorandum, or at any other time. 32 145. Plaintiff’s Proffer also listed Lawrence Poree, stating: Lawrence Poree was interrogated on two occasions in 1973 by Burge and Hoke. The first time they showed him a wooden box, with no top and a generator inside with two wires. Burge said “this is what we got for niggers like you.” Later (that year) Burge and Hoke put Poree, while handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants down and applied electric shock to his arm, testicles and under his armpits. 146. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: Lawrence Poree will testify that on two occasions in 1973, he was interrogated by respondent Burge and another detective. The first time they showed him a wooden box with no top, a generator inside, and two wires. Burge then said, “this is what we’ve got for niggers like you.” Later in 1973, Burge and  Hoke put Poree, while handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants down and applied electroshock to his arm and armpits, and to his testicles. On August 7, 1979, Poree was arrested and brought to Area II where he was interrogated by Burge. Poree was handcuffed in the interrogation room, and the black box was on the table. Burge came in and said, “fun time again.” Poree was handcuffed to the wall and hit in the head with a pistol. Apparently referring to Anthony Holmes, Burge said “You can ask your fat friend about the box.” Burge shocked Poree eight or nine times on the arms, chest, forehead, and back, causing him to clench his teeth and bite his tongue and his mouth to bleed. (Memorandum In Opposition, January 22, 1992, pp. 13-14. 147. On April 19, 2004 Lawrence Poree gave a Court reported statement in which he described the allegations which were made in Plaintiff’s Proffer in more detail. 148. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Lawrence Poree’s allegations either in response Plaintiff Wilson’s Proffer, in response to the January 22, 1992, City Memorandum, or at any other time. 149. In U.S. ex. rel. Maxwell v. Gilmore, 1999 WL 130331 (N.D.Ill.) at *14; Judge Shadur stated the following in his decision: It is now common knowledge that in the early to mid-1980s Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse 33 and torture of prisoners to extract confessions. Both internal police accounts and numerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that those beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice, not just on an isolated basis. 150. At the May 13, 2003 oral argument in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in US ex. rel. Leonard Hinton v. McArdory, Seventh Circuit Judge Diane Wood made the following statement from the bench: “terrible things were happening in Area 2, things that should make us ashamed of our police force and justice system.” 151. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 120 F.3d 681, 683-85 (7th Cir. 1997), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that Defendant Burge acted within the scope of his employment with the City “when he tortured Wilson,” stating: Burge was not pursuing a frolic of his own. He was enforcing the criminal law of Illinois overzealously by extracting confessions from criminal suspects by improper means. He was, as it were, too loyal an employee. He was acting squarely within the scope of his employment. 152. OPS investigator Veronica  Messenger was assigned to investigate the reopened Darrel Cannon OPS complaint (CR #134723) in May, 1993. CR # 134723, TillmanMessenger Testimony, People v. Cannon. 153. Pursuant to that investigation, she located the site Cannon had previously described as the location where he had been allegedly tortured. Id. 154. This location was under a viaduct at 12409 S. Torrence, and Tillman-Messenger had photographs taken of the site. Id. 155. OPS Investigator  Messenger finished her investigation in January of 1994, and entered sustained findings against all three accused officers, finding that: a) Sergeant Byrne struck Cannon with a cattle prod on his testicles and penis and in his mouth; 34 b) Sergeant Byrne repeatedly called Cannon a “nigger;” c) Sergeant Byrne held a 9 mm handgun to Cannon’s head; e) Sergeant Byrne attempted to lift Cannon by the handcuffs; d) Detective Dignan played Russian roulette with a shotgun with Cannon; e) Detective Dignan attempted to lift Cannon by his handcuffs; f) Detective Dignan put a shotgun to Cannon’s head; g) Detective Grunhard lifted Cannon up while Byrne held onto the cuffs. 156. These findings in CR #134723 were approved by Ms. Messenger’s supervisor at OPS, Carmen Christia. Id. 157. The reopened Cannon OPS file and the sustained findings were forwarded to OPS Director Gayle Shines for her review sometime in 1994. Id. 158. Director Gayle Shines took no action on these findings from receipt of the findings and file in 1994 until her leaving the post of Director in 1998, and kept the Cannon file and findings in her office from receipt until her leaving. Shines Dep., Benefico Dep., Santiago v. Marquez. 159. No Chicago police or City of Chicago official or employee, including, but not limited to, Defendants Shines, Martin, Hillard, and Needham produced the reopened Cannon file and the sustained findings contained therein to Mr. Cannon, Plaintiff Patterson, Leroy Orange, Stanley Howard or their lawyers in their criminal cases from 1994 to 1999. 156. No Chicago police or City of Chicago official or employee, including, but not limited to, Defendants Shines, Martin, Hillard, and Needham, produced the reopened Cannon file and sustained findings to any other criminal defendant or his lawyers in his criminal case, or to any Cook County Assistant State’s Attorney from 1994 to 1999. 157. This file and the findings, was further withheld, despite repeated discovery demands, from several civil litigants alleging torture and abuse. See, e.g., Santiago v. Marquez, 35 Wiggins v. City of Chicago. 158. After Darrell Cannon presented evidence that he was tortured to the Illinois Prisoner Review Board on August 27, 2004 and September 3, 2004 at his parole revocation hearing, Board Chairman Jorge Montes was quoted in the September 10, 2004 Chicago Tribune as saying that he was “‘inclined to believe’ Cannon’s claim that detectives working under former police Cmdr John Burge extracted a confession from Cannon through torture” and that “personally, I was inclined to believe there was torture.” Chicago Tribune, September 10, 2004. 159. After Darrell Cannon presented evidence that he was tortured to the Illinois Prisoner Review Board on August 27, 2004 and September 3, 2004, Board Chairman Jorge Montes was quoted in the September 10, 2004 Chicago Sun Times as saying “was there credibility to the  testimony? My inclination is to say ‘yes,’ Mr. Cannon may have been tortured. We found it fairly credible.” Chicago Sun Times, September 10, 2004. 160. Philip Adkins testified at his deposition in his civil case that after he was arrested on June 7, 1984, officers Ron Boffo, James Lotito and Peter Dignan transported him from his home on the south side of Chicago to the vicinity of 53rd and Federal Streets, where they struck him repeatedly about the genitals and abdomen with flashlights until he defecated on himself. Adkins deposition, pp. 5, 13-17. 161. Sergeant John Byrne admitted that he was present at Adkins’ house when he was arrested. Byrne Dep. p. 157; 1985 OPS Statement of John Byrne in CR 142201. 162. According to medical records, Adkins was transported to Area 2 and he eventually was taken to Roseland Community Hospital where a urinalysis showed a trace of blood in his 36 urine. He was then immediately transferred to Cook County Hospital. Adkin’s Medical Records from Roseland Community Hospital, CR 142201. 163. According to medical records, at Cook County Hospital Adkins was diagnosed with multiple blunt trauma, and he complained of having been beaten by the police with flashlights. Adkin’s Medical Records from Cook County Hospital, CR 142201. 164. On May 4, 1993, OPS re-opened an investigation into Adkins’ charges of abuse and investigator Leutie Lawrence was assigned to investigate the charges. People v. Cannon, 9/24/99, p. 18. 165. During the course of the investigation, Adkins again identified Boffo, Lotito and Dignan as the officers who had abused him on June 7, 1984.

Burge said, “You’re not going to talk, huh?” and Mumin replied that he didn’t know what Burge was talking about. Burge said, “do you know that we can bury you in the penitentiary?” Mumin replied that he still didn’t know what Burge was talking about. Burge then told Mumin that they really wanted his son, and Mumin repeated that he didn’t know what Burge was talking about. Burge became angry and pulled out a fully loaded .44 Magnum. He took out all the bullets except for one, spun it, placed it at 42 Mumin’s head and snapped it three times slowly. Burge told Mumin he was “damned lucky” that Burge didn’t kill him and that he wanted to know about the “fucking robbery.” Burge became angry, jumped up from the desk and snatched a brownish plastic typewriter cover. He said, “you’ll fucking talk or I’ll kill you,” and placed the cover over his head. Burge held the cover over his head and pushed it down in his face so he couldn’t breathe. Mumin, who was handcuffed behind his back, passed out. Burge put it on his head three times. The third time, Mumin hollered and Burge took the cover off and laughed.

White Deposition in Wilson v. City, 86 C 2360, 7/14/89, pp. 8-9, 17. 212. White further testified that the detectives asked him questions about who killed police officers Fahey and O’Brien, then Hill got angry and said “I’m tired of this fucking shit,” placed a black garbage bag over his head, and then beat him in the head and his chest. Id. at 18, 22, 41. 213. White testified that Hill put the bag over his head two additional times, and that while he was bagged, he was beaten over his head, preventing him from breathing.

Id. at 42, 62. 219. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted: On the evening of February 12, 1982, two days before Andrew Wilson’s arrest, Donald White was picked up by police officers and taken to 11th and State. He was taken to a room on the 5th floor by Hill, McKenna, Katalinic and respondent O’Hara, and they began asking him who killed the police officers. They continued to ask him and White repeatedly told them that he did not shoot the officers. Hill got mad and said “I am tired of this fucking shit.” He took a black garbage bag and put it over White’s head and then someone began beating him on his head. Although he could not see them with the bag over his head, there had to have been at least four people hitting him. O’Hara was in the room, as was Burge at various times. When White still stated that he did not shoot the officers and did not know anything, they put the bag back over his head two more times and beat him again. White almost lost consiousness. At one point, someone stuck a gun in his mouth. White then said he would tell them anything they wanted to know. Hill then asked him questions, and, when White didn’t have it right, Hill pretended he was going to hit White. White testified to these facts in a deposition taken in connection with Andrew Wilson’s civil trial. White had not told anyone for five years that he had been abused because he feared for his life at the hands of the police officers. When he finally agreed to testify about the abuse he suffered, he did so only on the condition that Wilson’s lawyers would move him out of Illinois. In addition, because he was afraid and did not know who he could trust, he did not file an OPS complaint. His mother, however, did file an OPS complaint in connection with his torture at the hands of the police officers. OPS reached a finding of “not sustained.” 48 Memorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992 in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, et. al. , Cases # 1856-58, pp. 10-11. 221.

On November 1, 1999 at a motion to suppress hearing in People v. Cannon, Dr. Robert Kirschner testified as an expert that he was a forensic pathologist, a member of the Human Rights Program at the University of Chicago, a forensic consultant to physicians for human rights, that he had participated in several missions and investigations around the world investigating police and other governmental torture, that over the past 15 years he has evaluated approximately 200 torture victims around the world, and that he has often been called on to evaluate whether there is systematic torture being practiced by the police and other governmental authorities. Kirschner further testified that he has done much of his work on behalf of the United Nations, for whom he has written portions of a protocol which defines the methodologies of torture and how to properly investigate and evaluate cases of alleged torture. People v. Cannon, 11/1/99, pp. 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96. 345. Dr. Kirschner further testified in Cannon that in his experience and opinion, electric shocking, plastic bagging or dry submarino, Russian roulette and other forms of mock executions, and hanging by handcuffs are common forms of police and governmental torture used across the world. Id. at 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96. 346. Dr. Kirschner further testified that in his opinion there was a pattern and practice of torture at Area 2 and later at Area 3 Headquarters under the command of Jon Burge, and that this opinion was based, inter alia, on his evaluations of several alleged Area 2 and 3 torture 71 victims, including Andrew Wilson, Darrell Cannon, Leroy Orange and Marcus Wiggins, discussions with Chicago detectives who acknowledged that there was police torture at Area 2, the fact that frequent allegations of electric shock, bagging, Russian Roulette only arose from Area 2 and later from Area 3 Headquarters while Jon Burge was the commander, and not against other officers in other station houses, and that the patterns and methodologies at Area 2 and 3 under Burge and Byrne closely mirrored those which he observed, investigated, and evaluated in places such as Turkey and Israel. Id. at 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96. 347. In an affidavit executed in August of 2004, Richard Brzeczek averred that he was the Chicago Police Superintendent from January 11, 1980 until April 29,1983. Affidavit of Richard Brzeczek, ¶1. 348. Brzeczek further averred that he made the following true and accurate statements to Chicago Tribune reporter Steve Mills which appeared in an April 29 2002 Chicago Tribune article: Twenty years later, Brzeczek, now a defense attorney, said that there is ‘no doubt in my mind’ that Burge and his detectives tortured some suspects. The whole situation at Area 2  a disgrace and an embarrassment. It’s time something is done about it,” Brzeczek said, referring to the former Burnside station on the southside where most of the torture allegedly occurred. Id., ¶¶ 4-5. 349. Brzeczek further averred that “subsequent to  resignation from the Chicago Police Department,  monitored litigation initiated by persons making claims and/or allegations regarding torture sustained at the hands of police officers at Detective Division Area 2.  further monitored the prosecution of certain police officers previously assigned to Area 2 based on allegations of torture and other improper treatment of prisoners under their control 72 before the Chicago police Board.  also monitored media coverage of allegations and legal actions arising out of allegations of torture and other improper treatment brought by persons against police officers assigned to Detective Division Area 2.” Id., ¶ 10. 350. Brzeczek further averred that “based on the fact that allegations continued to arise alleging torture and other improper treatment occurring at a time after  left the Chicago Police Department on April 29, 1983, and based upon the fact that Richard M. Daley, State’s Attorney of Cook County, did not conduct (or at least affiant is not aware of any such action), any investigation into the allegations brought to his attention by the affiant in the letter as aforesaid, affiant was and is convinced that some persons held in custody at Area 2 had to be tortured.” Id., ¶11. 351. In his affidavit, Brzeczek further averred that “based on the sheer number of the allegations, the findings of the courts in certain litigation brought against officers assigned to the Detective Division Area 2, and the fact that police officers were discharged and/or suspended for their roles in allegations made against them for the improper treatment of prisoners while assigned to Detective Division Area 2, the affiant was and is convinced that some persons were tortured while in custody at Detective Division Area 2.” Id., ¶12. 352.

On October 11, 1989, Chief Office of Professional Standards Administrator David Fogel testified before the Chicago City Council and gave the following answers to the following questions by Alderman Rush: Q: All right. Mr. Fogel, what have you done to discourage, well, first of all do you acknowledge the fact that there is a code of silence that exists in the Chicago 75 Police Department? A: In all professions. Q: Okay. And its, do you acknowledge - - - A: Including, including the Chicago Police Department. City Council Hearing, Committee on Police, Fire an Municipal Institutions, Public Hearing on Police Brutality, Day 5, October 11, 1989, p. 285. 357. On October 11, 1989, Police Superintendent Leroy Martin testified before the Chicago City Council and gave the following answers to the following question by Alderman Caldwell: Q: One final question, Superintendent, and this was asked of Dr. Fogel on numerous occasions. It has to do with the suggested code of silence among police officers. As Superintendent of Chicago’s Police Department, do you agree or - - - A: Yes. Q: Do you agree that there is in fact in force and functioning a code of silence among police officers? A: To some extent, yes, sir. Id., pp. 368-69. 358. On or about October 19, 1987, OPS Director Fogel sent a document entitled “Proposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,” to the Mayor of the City of Chicago in which he wrote: By accepting all cases, even erring on the liberal side, to be accommodative to the public, OPS gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints. The opposite occurs. The appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process and endless unnecessary reviews for all, actually operates to immunize police from internal discipline, increases their overtime, leads to an enormous “paper storm” and has institutionalized lying. “Proposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,” October 19, 1987, p. 2. 359.  360. In Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d 985, (7th Cir. 1987) the Seventh Circuit 76 Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict against Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives, supervisors and commanding officers, including detectives James Houtsma, Dennis McGuire, John McCabe, and Raymond McNally, Sgt. Alvin Palmer, Lt. Griffith, and Commander Milton Deas, for conspiracy to “railroad” 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating: We cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the individual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to railroad George Jones. Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d at 992. 361. In Jones v. City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the City of Chicago for maintaining a “street files”custom or policy which led to the railroading of 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating: The custom in question is the maintenance of the ""street files,"" police files withheld from the state\'s attorney and therefore unavailable as a source of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute or, failing that, would at least be available to defense counsel under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). As we noted recently, information undermining the credibility of a government witness is within the scope of Brady\'s rule. See United States v. Herrera-Medina, 853 F.2d 564, slip op. at 5 (7th Cir. 1988). Although the lawfulness of the street-files practice has never been adjudicated, the City, which has abandoned the practice, does not challenge the jury\'s implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process of law. Brady v. Maryland does not require the police to keep written records of all their investigatory activities; but attempts to circumvent the rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files deliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be tolerated. The City sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in this court. There is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files played a role in Jones\'s misfortunes. Cf. Harris v. City of Pagedale, 821 F.2d 499, 507 (8th Cir. 1987). If the state\'s attorney had had  access to them, he would have discovered memos by Kelly and especially by Laverty that would have given any prosecutor pause. Alternatively, defense 77 counsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have ended even sooner than it did. The only question is whether this custom was a custom of the City of Chicago. As the custom was department-wide and of long standing, the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been consciously approved at the highest policy-making level for decisions involving the police department -- the standard suggested by the recent plurality opinion in City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S. Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988). See also Stokes v. Bullins, 844 F.2d 269, 273 (5th Cir. 1988). Jones, 856 F. 2d at 995. 362.

Michael Johnson testified at his June 14, 1989 deposition in Wilson v. City of Chicago that Jon Burge picked him up and took him to Area 2 at 91st and Cottage Grove in June of 1982. Johnson Dep., 6/14/89, pp. 7-8. 374. He further testified that Burge, in the presence of two other officers, questioned him about a homicide, beat him, shocked him with an electrical device, pointed a gun in his face and at his head, asked him if he was ready to talk, threw a chair at him, hit him in the face, and hit him on the head with a gun.

Judge Duff, the Judge in Wilson v. City of Chicago, ruled that Burge’s name could not be used by Porch before the jury; hence Porch referred to Burge as Sergeant X in his Wilson testimony. Wilson v. City of Chicago, 6/27/89, pp. 1874-92. 384. Timothy Thompson testified at his motion to suppress hearing on May 24, 1984 that he was arrested by Jon Burge and other officers on September 29, 1979, he was choked and hit in the eye by one of the arresting officers at the time he was arrested, that he was taken in a squad car by Burge and another Area 2 detective to the police station at 90th and Cottage Grove, and he was questioned by Burge and this detective at the police station People v.

""Plaintiff\'s Proffer of Other Acts of Beating, Torture and Electroshock By Defendant Burge and Other Detectives,"" filed on May 11, 1989 and served on the City of Chicago by Andrew Wilson\'s lawyers in Wilson’s civil rights trial set forth that: Edward James and James Lewis were arrested in Memphis, Tennessee by Burge and Area 2 detective Wagner. Burge said “wait until we get you back to the horror chamber. We know how to squeeze a man’s nuts.” When they returned to Chicago, Burge asked if the man on duty was the one who killed Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. Burge said “when we get through with you you’ll be glad to tell us what we want.” Area 2 Burge presided over the interrogation of Lewis and James in separate rooms. Burge laughed when each asked for an attorney saying “you know better than that.’ Lewis was hit in the throat and slapped in the side of the head, injuring his eardrum. When James refused to talk, he was struck in the mouth by Burge and punched in the neck. James was told he was “gonna talk before 12:00.” 538. James and Lewis previously set forth their versions of their arrests, transport, interrogations, and abuse in their testimony at their motion to suppress hearing in March of 1980. People v. James and Lewis, 3/10/80. 539. James again detailed these events in a law suit he filed and in a court reported statement given in Patterson v. Burge on April 19, 2004. 540.

They drove him around in their police vehicle, pointed their guns at him and then pulled the triggers, but the chambers were empty. He was taken to Area II where he was interrogated and beaten by Burge and Hoke for one and one half hours, during which time they put a rope around his neck in a noose-like fashion, and injured his throat. When Reverend Daniel, a police Board member, came to Area II to inquire about Collins, he was released. An OPS complaint was subsequently filed. 542. . 105 543.  544.  545. . 546.

He further averred that they stuffed papers down his throat until he was gagging and bleeding, beat him on his arm where he had previously been burned while cooking, handcuffed him to the wall and whipped him with phone books and other objects; that his eye was messed up pretty badly, he was bleeding like a pig, and they kept trying to get him to confess to shooting the man. Id., ¶ 5. 548. Billingsley further averred that at one point the arresting detectives opened the door a girl he knew from high school saw him and started screaming for them to stop. Id.,¶ 6. 549. Billingsley averred that they beat him the next day, they took him into his neighborhood, he was bleeding a lot, he was seen by his family, by Henry Little, who was the man who committed the shooting, and Little’s father, and they came into the station because they thought the police would kill him if they didn’t.

Robert Billingsley further averred that his mother called in a complaint to OPS and sometime later, Dwyer and one of the other white detectives who had beaten him came to his house and offered him $3000 to drop the complaint. He further averred that he agreed to drop the complaint, and that Dwyer and the other officer drove him to some office to do so. Id. ¶¶ 10-11. 552. In his affidavit, Billingsley averred that given what the detectives had already done to him, he was afraid for his life. Id., ¶ 14. 553. In a sworn court reported statement dated July 24, 2004, Rodney Mastin averred that on August 4 or 5, 1972 detectives, including Jon Burge came to his house and took him and Philip “Smoky” Moore to Area 2 for questioning about a home invasion which had left a young white boy severely injured. Statement of Rodney Mastin, pp 4-6. 554. In his statement, Mastin averred that on August 4 or 5, 1972, Area 2 detectives, including Jon Burge, took him and Moore up the stairs at Area 2 then past a room where he saw an unrecognizable person handcuffed to the wall in a room he walked by. He further averred that the young black male looked like he had been in a car accident, with his facial features distorted, swollen and bleeding, apparently seriously injured and unconscious. Id., pp 7-9. 555. In his statement, Mastin averred that Burge and the other detectives then took him and Moore into an open room, told them that they knew that he and “Smoky” were involved in a home invasion during which a young boy had been severely beaten, and that before they left the room they were going to tell them everything they knew about the case. Id., pp 8-10. 556.

Mastin averred that he gave a written statement so the beatings would stop. Id., pp 16-18. 561. Mastin further averred that pictures were taken of Smith which showed his distorted face and that Moore later told him that he was punched during his questioning. Id., pp 19-20. 562. In his statement, Mastin averred that there was a motion to suppress hearing at which evidence of the beatings was presented and at which Burge and other detectives testified and denied any abuse. Id., pp 25-26. 563. In a sworn court reported statement taken on August 25, 2004, Ollie Hammonds averred that on or about September 21, 1979, he was arrested by Chicago Police officers, 108 including Jon Burge, and George Basile,, and taken to Area 2 where he was questioned about the same homicide that George Powell was arrested for. 8/25/04 Hammonds Statement, pp. 2-5. 564. Hammonds further averred that when he denied involvement, Burge, Basile, and two other detectives beat him on his chest and legs. These beatings continued for six to eight hours. Id. pp. 6-8. 565. Hammonds further averred that sometime during this six to eight hour period, Basile produced a black box, the size of a car battery, which had prongs sticking up and two wires extending from it. Id., pp. 8-9. 566. Hammonds further averred that Burge asked him did he know what this did to a man’s dick if we put the two wires on it, and Basile demonstrated it by touching the two wires together, and sparks jumped out. Id., p. 9. 567. Hammonds averred that he told them he would tell them what they wanted him to say, but he would tell the judge that they told him to say it. The detectives were not satisfied, and they moved him to a cell where they handcuffed him to the wall, and held him incommunicado for two and one half days, without food, water, or access to the washroom. Id., pp. 9-10, 13 568. Hammonds further averred that during this period of time, he refused to cooperate, and Burge, Basile, and the other detectives punched him on numerous occasions. Id., pp. 10-11. 569. Hammonds averred that he was charged with the same murder as George Powell was charged with, was held inCounty Jail for 33 days, then released when the Judge found no probable cause. Id., pp. 15-16. 570. In an OPS statement, Ty Shaun Ross stated that he was electric shocked and otherwise abused by Area 3 detectives, including Daniel McWeeny, while he was being 109 interrogated on June 5, 1991. CR 185626. 571.  while his co-defendant, Travis Richardson, stated that his head was slammed on a table. . 572. All of the 100 alleged victims of police torture and abuse by Area 2 and Area 3 detectives and supervisors whose allegations are known to the Plaintiff are African-American. Plaintiff’s Listing of Known Burge, Area 2 and 3 Torture Victims, 1972-1991. 573. On April 24, 2002, Judge Paul Biebel, Chief Judge of the Cook County Criminal Division, appointed Special Prosecutors Edward Egan and Robert Boyle to investigate allegations of police torture and abuse at Area 2 and Area 3. 574. On June 8, 2004, in open court, Special Prosecutor Robert Boyle stated that the Special Prosecutor’s Office was investigating 108 cases of alleged torture and physical abuse at Area 2 and 3. In Re: The Matters of Leonard Bajenski, et. al., June 8, 2004, p. 27. 575. From 1972 to the present, the only police department discipline which has been imposed against any Area 2 or Area 3 detective, supervisor, or command officer for any allegations of torture or physical abuse made against them has been the firing of Jon Burge and the suspension of John Yucaitis for the torture of Andrew Wilson on February 14, 1982. 576. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has conducted no criminal investigations into any of the allegations of torture or other physical abuse made against Area 2 and Area 3 detectives and supervisors, including, but not limited to, the alleged victims named above. 577. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has not sought criminal charges against any Area 2 and Area 3 detective or supervisor on the basis of 110 allegations of torture or other physical abuse, including, but not limited to, those made by the alleged victims named above. 578. On February 11, 1993., the Chicago Police Board ordered that Jon Burge be separated from the Chicago Police Department and John Yucaitis be suspended for 15 months for torturing and physically abusing Andrew Wilson. In The Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon Burge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). 579. On February 10, 1994, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Thomas O’Brien affirmed the Police Board’s order separating Burge and suspending Yucaitis, and on December 15, 1995, the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed Judge O’Brien’s ruling.

In a May 21, 2003 Chicago Tribune article, Special Prosecutor Egan was quoted as saying: ""We believe something happened. You\'d have to be a chump not to."" “Probers Believe Brutality Claims,” Chicago Tribune, May 21, 2003. 583. On March 3, 1998, upon becoming Police Superintendent, Terry Hillard told the Chicago Sun Times that “barring new evidence, it\'s time to close the book on the Burge era and move on.” Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36, 43-46 584. In an August 31, 1998 memo from the office of the Superintendent , Thomas Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional Standards, Needham listed the following cases: Darrell Cannon CR#134723 Stanley Howard CR# 142017 Gregory Banks CR# 188617 Lee Holmes CR# 126802 Philip Adkins CR# 142201 Donald White CR# 169867 Lavert Jones CR# 200390 Stanley Ware CR# 202019 112 Michael Johnson CR# 125071 and wrote that “you are hereby instructed to classify all of the allegations in the above referenced complaint register files as ‘not sustained.’” August 31, 1998 memo from Thomas Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional Standards. 585. As a basis for this unprecedented order, Needham cited the age of the cases and the purported lack of “new evidence,” when, in fact, a wealth of new evidence had been developed by the OPS investigators in almost all of the cases. Id.; CR files of listed cases; Testimony of OPS investigators at People v. Cannon Hearing. 586. Superintendent Hillard, after talking to Neeedham about his decision, ratified his actions in “not sustaining’” these cases, stating, under oath, that “I support Tom Needham 100 percent when it comes down to representing me in this department in hard cases like that.” Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36. 587. In a letter dated August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, addressed to Superintendent Terry Hillard, OPS Director Callie Baird and Police Board President Demitrius Carney, the signators wrote: We write as a group of public officials, citizens and organizations concerned with police violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several Office of Professional Standards (OPS) investigations into police torture, and to open investigations in numerous other torture cases where no OPS investigations have been conducted. We further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the obvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain OPS and police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the OPS. August 2, 1999 Letter from Citizens Alert, Mary Powers et. al. to Hillard, Carney, and Baird. 588. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators further wrote: 113 Recent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the OPS reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior OPS findings that physical abuse of African American suspects at Area 2 from 1973 to 1986 included ""psychological techniques and planned torture,"" was ""systematic,"" and ""methodical,"" and that Area 2 command members, particularly Jon Burge, ""were aware of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end."" Goldston Report, pp 2-3. The now public evidence further reveals that OPS investigators Tillman, Lawrence, and Cosey conducted thorough investigations in each of these cases, discovered new evidence not available during the initial investigations, and sustained findings in six of the cases. The sustained findings included findings that victims were electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic bag, suspended in air by their handcuffs, beaten and stomped, and racially abused. The evidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police officers who were and are still Chicago police officers in good standing, most notably Lieutenant Peter Dignan, who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him in five of the six cases. The evidence further reveals that these findings and the investigative files were tendered to OPS Director Gayle Shines in 1994 for her review, and that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995, at the same time that Peter Dignan was nominated by the Mayor and the Department for merit promotion to Lieutenant. Ms. Shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500 sustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as Director, she overturned a total of 10 cases, including these four against Dignan. The evidence further shows that in the other two cases, Darrell Cannon and Stanley Howard, Ms. Shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture, but rather kept these files in her office for four years, together with the other seven files. Cannon, who was on trial in a murder case, and Howard, who is on death row, sought these files by subpoena, but Shines and the Department failed to produce these files, which contained highly exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, after Ms. Shines left the OPS in 1998, counsel to the Superintendent, Thomas Needham, obtained the nine torture files from the OPS and, without consultation with the Superintendent, summarily reversed the sustained findings and closed the cases. Needham, who, as a longtime assistant state’s attorney, was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims, including Cannon, admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on the merits of the cases, but rather on the fact that the files had languished in Shines’ office for so long a period of time. The Superintendent never reviewed these cases on the merits as he is required by police procedure to do, and he only learned of his counsel’s unjustifiable actions by reading about them in a February 1999 Chicago Tribune article. Additionally, the public evidence reveals that the OPS failed to investigate numerous additional documented cases of police torture against African American suspects. In the case of Melvin Jones, Mary Powers of Citizen’s Alert specifically requested by a letter dated July 26, 1989 that the OPS open an investigation into the recently revealed allegations that Jones was electric shocked at by Jon Burge and several other Area 2 detectives who remain on the force to this day. Contrary to police and OPS procedure, no investigation was ever opened, despite the fact that the City has subsequently admitted in 114 official court papers that Jones was in fact tortured. Similarly, in the Shadeed Mumin case, an investigation was opened and OPS investigators developed compelling new evidence that he was tortured by Burge and an unidentified detective. Just as the OPS investigator was about to identify this officer, the OPS discontinued the investigation, supposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number. In numerous other cases, including Aaron Patterson and nine other men who are presently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from them, the OPS has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious allegations. Id. 589. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators made the following demands: 1. Given Ms. Shines’ clear misconduct, lack of objectivity, and failure to complete her review of the Cannon and Howard sustained findings, that new OPS Director, Callie Baird, conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture cases; 2. If Ms. Baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings, that the Superintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits, as he is required by police procedure to do; 3. That counsel Thomas Needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or otherwise participating in any torture investigations; 4. That Peter Dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were entered by OPS investigators be suspended pending complete review; 5. That the department and its OPS open an investigation into the allegations that Melvin Jones was electric shocked by Jon Burge and other still active detectives and consider in making its findings that the City has admitted that Jones was in fact tortured; 6. That the Department and its OPS reopen and complete the Shadeed Mumin investigation; 7. That the Department and its OPS open investigations into the other numerous documented cases of police torture, as listed in the Appendix attached hereto, including those allegations made by men on death row; 8. That the Department commission an independent investigation into the serious violations of departmental rules and court process by high ranking police and OPS officials, including Thomas Needham and Gayle Shines; 9. That the Department and the OPS Director meet with representatives from the undersigned groups and discuss these proposals and to periodically report on the progress of these investigations; 10.That these investigations and findings be subject to public scrutiny.

Other than Hillard’s meeting with representatives from the signators of the August 2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter, no action was taken on any of the demands made in the letter. 116 594. In an e mail dated 1/10/02, Corporation Counsel Mara S. Georges wrote to her assistant: “Sheila O’Grady would like us to explore bringing an action against Burge. Will you please think about it and give us your thoughts?” “New documents Report that City Considered Suing Burge, City continues Paying For Fired Commander’s Legal Defense,” NBC 5.com., 4/29/04. 595. On January 1, 2002, Sheila O’Grady was Mayor Daley’s Chief of Staff. Id. 596. In response, Jeffrey Given, Georges’ assistant, wrote that suing Burge “would seem to undercut our ability to defend  suit by challenging the underlying facts . . .” “City Considered Suing Burge; Officials Weighed Their Options to Fight Growing Uproar over Torture Allegations Against the Fired Police Commander,” Chicago Tribune, 4/29/04. 597. Mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum, Given and Georges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative publicity about Burge and the City’s role in the torture scandal. Id. 598. Given and Georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide variety of reasons, including that some of Burge’s men were still on the police force, the department had been embarrassed by Needham’s unilateral shelving of the OPS torture investigations despite the investigators’ sustained findings, and that the Tribune’s then recent series on the continuing CPD practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention on the issue, and Given further stated “but query how we’ll do in the court of public opinion after a long, public, expensive and embarrassing discovery process?” NBC5.com; Chicago Tribune. 599. Instead of suing Burge, or otherwise distancing the City from him, the City decided 117 to invest unlimited public funds in representing Burge and at least thirty-five other Area 2 detectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and public disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the City’s central role in the torture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the Special Prosecutor. Id. 600. On August 27, 2004 in his sworn testimony before the Prisoner Review Board, former Area 2 Commander and Superintendent Leroy Martin falsely denied that he did not have contemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against Jon Burge and other Area 2 detectives while he was Commander. Tr. of 8/27/04 Parole Revocation Hearing of Darrell Cannon. 601. In her concurring opinion in Hinton v. Uchtman (sub. nom.)___F 3d ___ (7th Cir. 2005), Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood found: he claim Hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the high price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant: a cloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched . . .  mountain of evidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the Area Two station of the Chicago Police Department during the exact time period pertinent to Hinton\'s case. Eventually, as this sorry tale came to light, the Office of Professional Standards Investigation of the Police Department looked into the allegations, and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the command of Lt. Jon Burge — the officer in charge of Hinton\'s case — had been a regular part of the system for more than ten years. And, in language reminiscent of the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious Abu Ghraib facility in Iraq, the report said that ""he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture."" The report detailed specific cases, such as the case of Andrew Wilson, who was taken to Area Two on February 14, 1982. There a group led by Burge beat Wilson, stuffed a bag over his head, handcuffed him to a radiator, and repeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears, nose, and genitals. See People v. Wilson, 506 N.E.2d 571 (Ill. 1987). Burge eventually lost his job with the police, though not until 1992. See In the Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon Burge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). To this day, Burge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions, though it appears that he at least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution. See, for example, 118 ""Cop brutality probe must be thorough, fair,"" Chi. Sun-Times, May 16, 2002 (editorial); Hal Dardick, ""Burge repeatedly takes 5th; Former police commander stays mum on torture questions,"" Chi. Tribune, Sept. 2, 2004 (noting allegations that Burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 Black and Latino suspects between August 1972 and September 1991). . . . Behavior like that attributed to Burge imposes a huge cost on society: it creates distrust of the police generally, despite the fact that most police officers would abhor such tactics, and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in which the problem officer played a role. Indeed, the alleged conduct is so extreme that, if proven, it would fall within the prohibitions established by the United Nations Convention Against Torture (""CAT""), which defines torture as ""any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession . . .,"" thereby violating the fundamental human rights principles that the United States is committed to uphold. . . .', "" Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars   Fresh out from my bid, bitch, it’s Lil Tunechi I Lucille Ball, bitch I love Lucy If these niggas dogs, I’m animal cruelty Don't fuck with me at all, cause I’m twisted like in a Rubik's Cube, oh my, look how the time has flown And they say time is of the essence, but what if their clock is wrong?

Down here on earth, an insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.  The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that\'s tearing down the road.  INT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT  The DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers, smearing the remains all over.  DRIVER Goddamn bugs.  The camera shows the back of the van, where seven illegal immigrants wait. The driver squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, and then sees something worse up ahead. Headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.  He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van.  DRIVER (CONT\'D) Oh shit! Deja me hablar. Oh crap!  EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT  The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue four doors with ""INS"" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward and comes to the window.  The DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also government issue, looks at him and sighs.  AGENT JANUS Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where you comin\' from?  DRIVER I was fishing in Cuernavaca.  AGENT JANUS Sure you were. What do you say we have a look at your catch, huh?  Come on.  AT THE BACK OF THE VAN,  the Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who\'s now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head.  AGENT JANUS Me, I woulda thrown \'em back. (to the passengers, in Spanish) Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina! (Let\'s go. Out. Form a line!)  They pile out of the van.  AGENT JANUS (CONT\'D) What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all for your lawyer, pal, \'cause you\'re gonna need it.  Another car is approaching, fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several Agents pull their weapons.  The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It\'s a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.  TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents.  KAY We\'ll take it from here.  AGENT JANUS Who the hell are you?  Kay and Dee flash some form of ID.  KAY INS Division 6.  AGENT JANUS Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.  KAY Really?  Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.  KAY (CONT\'D) What\'re we thinking, Dee?  DEE Tough call, Kay.  He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in subtitled Spanish.  KAY !Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey! (What\'s up, how are you?) Abuela, no se preocupe, . Bienvenida a los Estados Unidos. (Don\'t worry grandma. Welcome to the United States.) A donde vas? Nogales? Buscando trabajo, no? Tu, lo mismo? (Where are you going? Nogales?  Looking for work?  You too?) Y tu? Es un placer verle aqui. (And you? It\'s a pleasure seeing you here.)  One by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay\'s calm demeanor. When he reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:  KAY (CONT\'D) Que dices si te rompo la cara? (What do you say if I break your face?)  The Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a hand on the Guy\'s shoulder.  KAY (CONT\'D) Es muy feo, no? Y no hablas ni una palabra del Español! (You\'re very ugly, aren\'t you? You don\'t speak a word of Spanish!)  Again, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee.  KAY (CONT\'D) We got a winner here, Dee  DEE  (also laughing) Oh, I know!  KAY (CONT\'D) (to the others) Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense! (The rest of you are free to go. Scram!)  AGENT JANUS No se mueven! (Don\'t move!)  KAY Tomen el camion, y vayeuse. (Get on the road and go.)  AGENT JANUS Sir! Sir, you can\'t just --  KAY Don\'t ""Sir"" me! You have no idea who you\'re dealing with!  Silence on the road. The Driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the van. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.  KAY (CONT\'D) (to Janus) We\'re gonna have a little chat with our friend here. You boys can hit the road ... and keep on protecting us from dangerous aliens.  Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise, leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway.  AGENT JANUS You ever heard of Division 6?  2ND INS AGENT There is no Division 6. This is bullshit.  AGENT JANUS Yeah.  EXT. DESERT CLEARING - NIGHT  Kay and Dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush.  KAY Looks like you jumped off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo. In fact, I\'ll bet dollars to pesos that you\'re not from anywhere near here.  He pulls out a knife, and cuts the man\'s poncho. The man\'s clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is underneath -- an amphibian/reptile with two independent eyes and he also appeared to have a shell on his back, which had six small arms and hands. The only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the humanesque ""head,""  which he still lamely holds in one of his hands. It\'s propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions as he holds it.  KAY (CONT\'D) Mikey?!  MIKEY replies -- an unfathomable combination of GRUNTS, SQUEAKS, and saliva.  KAY (CONT\'D) Mikey?!  When did they let you out of jail?  Mikey replies.  KAY (CONT\'D) Political refugee. Right.  DEE You know how many treaties articles you\'ve just violated?  Mikey makes a lame SQUEAK.  KAY One?  DEE Try seven.  Mikey continues to talk.  KAY (off Mikey\'s objections) That\'s enough, Mikey. Hand me that head.  Mikey delivers the head prop.  KAY Now put up your arms and all your flippers.  As Mike continues to talk, Janus is climbing a hill behind them. He lets out a terrified GASP. One of the alien\'s eyes, on a tall stalk, whips around. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just over the rise, staring in frozen amazement. As the eye returns to place...  KAY (CONT\'D) Ah, shit.  Mikey gets mad and changes into an angry stance, with all flippers shaking this, and gets very mad. He knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus, SCREECHING a horrible Space Bastard screech as Agent Janus SCREAMS and freezes, terrified.  KAY (CONT\'D) Dee! Shoot him!  Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell out of his hand as he hit the ground.  KAY (CONT\'D) Dee!  Kay drops the head, puts his hand inside the jacket. Mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly. He steps on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide open --  -- there is a SIZZLING sound, a brilliant white flash --  -- and Mikey ERUPTS in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the ground, the trees, and Agent Janus\' face. Behind where Mikey was, Kay stands, smoking weapon in hand, and sighs.  EXT. DESERT CLEARING -- NIGHT  Janus walks further into the clearing. Janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.  AGENT JANUS Th -- th -- th --  KAY (helping) ""That.""  AGENT JANUS That wasn\'t -- wasn\'t -- wasn\'t --  KAY Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on you there, pal.  The INS AGENTS pull their guns and run toward the rise.  KAY Okay, everybody, situation\'s under control, calm down. If you\'ll just give me your attention for a moment I\'ll tell you what happened.  From over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder.  KAY (CONT\'D) This is called a ""neuralyzer."" A gift from some friends from out of town. The red eye here isolates and measures the electronic impulses in your brain. More specifically, the ones for memory.  Behind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses, come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them.  KAY (CONT\'D) Fellas, give me a splay burn around the perimeter with holes on the perimeter, please; holes at 40, 60, and 80 meters. Right here! Thank you!  TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the Men in Black. The Men in Black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.  2ND INS AGENT What in the hell is going on?!  Kay moves the dials on the Neuralyzer\'s back.  KAY Excellent question. The answer you\'re looking for lies right here.  JANUS Who are you, really?  KAY Really?  I\'m just a figment of your imagination.  He holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay  pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a tenth of a second long sears the Agents\' eyeballs. They stare blankly.  KAY (CONT\'D) God, we\'re a gullible breed.  Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming around, as if awakening from a concussion.  KAY (CONT\'D) I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be alive after a blast like that.  The Agents look around, confused.  AGENT JANUS What -- blast?  KAY Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need to exercise more caution before discharging your firearms.  He jabs a finger into Janus\' chest.  KAY (CONT\'D) Especially you.  Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away from the group and finds him. He sits down next to him.  DEE I\'m sorry. About...back there.  KAY Happens.  DEE Didn\'t used to.  He holds up his hands, which tremble with age.  DEE (CONT\'D) The spirit\'s willing, Kay, but the rest of me...  He looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.  DEE (CONT\'D) They\'re beautiful, aren\'t they?  KAY What?  DEE The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore. (back to Kay) I\'ll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase. I will miss the chase.  Kay puts the sunglasses, pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.  KAY No. You won\'t.  EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT  A shot of the clock on the Station\'s stately southern exposure. WE PAN DOWN TO...  A pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME.  A new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.  Edwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a chain under his shirt.  EDWARDS Stop! NYPD!  He continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS, overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air.  COP All yours, Edwards!  The Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.  TRACK WITH EDWARDS AND THE PERP  As they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties. The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it\'s a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first Street below.  EDWARDS is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn\'t waste a second. He, too, hurdles the guard rail and lands on...  EXT. 41ST STREET AND PARK AVENUE - NIGHT  A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown traffic. The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS, and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.  EDWARDS pushes through the crowd...  EDWARDS What the hell? It just be raining black people in New York.  With the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs out through the side door.  He spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street.  Edwards spots one of those New York Post delivery trucks, the kind with the open back door, rumbling by.  He runs and jumps into the back.  EXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT  THE PERP, meanwhile, is running at top speed, when Edwards glides into frame and pushes him towards a wall.  EDWARDS Do you see this? N.Y.P.D.! It means I will knock your punk-ass down!  The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.  PERP He\'s coming! He\'s coming!  EDWARDS And when he gets here, I\'ll kick his ass too.  Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp pulls out his WEAPON, which is the strangest looking gun you\'ve ever seen. Reacting quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp\'s hand. THE WEAPON smashes into the ground and explodes in fire.  EDWARDS You trying to catch a beat down?  As Edwards tries to ram his head on the wall, The Perp walks on it to backflip and land safely on his feet and take off again. Edwards hits the wall, and then goes runs after him.  The Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM. Edwards tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the Perp is gone.  EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- NIGHT  Edwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it, and in the next instant...  The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of the Guggenheim. He scrambles up and over the ledge.  Edward reacts. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and runs inside.  He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim.  EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- ROOF -- NIGHT  On the roof, the PERP reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and CRUNCHES to the gravel surface. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It\'s locked.  He tugs on another. It\'s locked too. He pulls on a third. It swings open --  -- revealing EDWARDS on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon at the Perp.  EDWARDS Wassup?  PERP He\'s coming! He\'s coming because I failed, and now he\'ll kill me too!  EDWARDS You pissing everybody off today, huh?  PERP You don\'t understand. Your world is gonna end.  The Perp blinks with another set of translucent, milky white eyelids, from the side of his eyeballs. Edwards is thrown off.  EDWARDS What are you?  The Perp backpedals, toward the edge of the roof.  EDWARDS Watch that ledge.Watch it.Come down. We\'ll get those eyes fixed.Don\'t even worry about it. Wait a minute. Let me talk to you!  But the Perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and starts to fall over, crashing to the ground.  CUT TO:  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT  A lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm country. A truck is parked in the driveway, and a cow grazes next to it. A Man (EDGAR)\'s voice is heard.  EDGAR (O.S.) I go out, I work my butt off to make a living, all I want is to come home to a nice clean house with a nice fat steak on the table, but instead I get this -- this -- I don\'t even know what you call this!  In the sky above, it\'s one of those brilliant star fields. But something strange is happening with one of those stars -- it\'s getting bigger.  EDGAR (O.S.) I\'ll tell you what it looks like, it looks like poison. Don\'t you take that away, I\'m eating that, damn it! It is poison, isn\'t it?!  No, that star isn\'t getting bigger, it\'s moving. Toward us. Fast. It goes from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way into fruit metaphors. The cow starts to walk away from the truck.  EDGAR (O.S.) I swear to God, I would not be surprised if it was, the way you skulk around here like a dog been hit too much -- or ain\'t been hit enough, I can\'t make up my mind.  Okay, we\'re way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it\'s starting to glow hot red as it enters the earth\'s atmosphere, headed straight toward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar\'s place.  The blazing fireball barrels through the sky, SNAPS off a couple trees --  EDGAR (O.S.) You\'re useless, Beatrice! The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck!  -- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.  The door opens. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun.  EDGAR Figures.  Edgar walks across the yard, going into the hulking shell that was his truck. The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there\'s a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.  BEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.  BEATRICE What is it, Edgar?!  EDGAR (turns to her) Get your big butt back in that house!  Beatrice does as she\'s told, closing the door behind her. Edgar approaches the hole. AN OTHERWORLDLY  VOICE comes from deep in the hole.  VOICE (O.S.) Place projectile weapon on ground.  Edgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.  EDGAR You can have my gun  when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers!  The voice responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar\'s.  VOICE (O.S.) Your proposal is acceptable.  A long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and pulls him down into the hole.  From deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to the truck.  It\'s Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face, arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the prom.  The thing is pulled back... and Edgar comes out, but rugged and dirty, and makes a sound as he moves his jaw.  CUT TO:  INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT  BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table. Edgar first hits the panel door, then opens it. He carries the shotgun. She looks up at him. But his face is a blank.  BEATRICE What on earth was it?!  He looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than before. More refined.  EDGAR Sugar.  BEATRICE I\'ve never seen sugar do that.  EDGAR Give me sugar.  Puzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar. She holds it out to him.  EDGAR (CONT\'D) In water.  Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of the sugar into it.  EDGAR (CONT\'D) More.  She puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling.  Edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck.  BEATRICE Edgar, your skin is hanging off your bones.  Edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He turns around, reaches up --  -- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, by pulling his hair up and stretching his whole face.  EDGAR That better?  Beatrice faints.  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT  The cow observes as a loud SCRAPING sound comes from the pit left by the spaceship. The flying saucer is rolled out of the pit by Edgar.   CUT TO:  INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT  EDWARDS sits on one side of the table, a POLICE INSPECTOR and a UNIFORMED SERGEANT (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit across from him.  INSPECTOR Perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?  EDWARDS No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then again with another completely different set.  SERGEANT Sort of a low beam, high beam.  INSPECTOR Was that before or after he drew the weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces?  EDWARDS After, sir.  INSPECTOR And why do you suppose none of the other officers saw either of these two events?  EDWARDS \'Cause some of the other officers are a little soggy in the midsection. And they couldn\'t keep up, sir.  SERGEANT Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I am --  EDWARDS What do you mean? I am half the man you are.  SERGEANT What the hell is your problem?  EDWARDS My problem is you being all up in my damn face all the time.  SERGEANT I think he threw him off the roof.  EDWARDS Maybe you\'re next.  INSPECTOR (cutting off the Sergeant) Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside. Now.  SERGEANT Ten minutes -- take your best shot.  EDWARDS Take ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard.  A woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish, dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then whispers to him.  LAUREL I believe you.  Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. Find me at the morgue on 26th. I\'ll tell you what I found.  EDWARDS Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  He turns around, but she\'s already in the corridor behind the room, but is STOPPED by someone who remains in shadow.  SHADOW (O.S.) You\'re Dr. Weaver, from the coroner\'s office? Working on the John Doe?  LAUREL Yes. That\'s right.  SHADOW (O.S.) Would you look right here, please.  A red flash hits Laurel, who keeps still on the hallway. Then KAY steps into the room and closes the door behind him. As he goes to the security camera to turn it off by the power cable...  KAY Some night, huh?  EDWARDS Oh, yeah, some night.  KAY They were gills. Not eyelids. Gills. He was out of breath.  EDWARDS Who are you?  KAY Did he say anything to you?  EDWARDS (scoffing) Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to an end.  KAY Did he say when?  Silence, as Edwards stares in disbelief.  KAY Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?  EDWARDS Absolutely.  KAY Let\'s take a ride.  EDWARDS Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.  KAY It\'s all done.  At that point, the INSPECTOR appears with a folder, smiles and gives Edwards the thumbs up.  INSPECTOR Good work, Edwards.  Edwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay. As they leave.  KAY You ran that guy down on foot? That\'s tough. That\'s double tough.  CUT TO:  INT. FORD LTD - A MOMENT LATER - DRIVING  A plain, boxy Ford approaches a pawn shop. Kay and Edwards\' voices are heard inside it.  EDWARDS So who you with?  KAY I\'m part of a secret organization that monitors and polices alien activity on earth.  EDWARDS Whatever.  KAY We\'re here.  Kay opens the door and gets out of the car. Edwards follows.  EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT  Edwards looks around. Sees they\'re standing in front of a PAWN SHOP.  EDWARDS This is where we\'re going?  KAY Yeah.  EDWARDS This is Jack Jeebs\' spot. He buys from chain snatchers. Doesn\'t even sell guns.  KAY Really?  EDWARDS All right, you think it\'s worth shaking him up, fine. I\'ll do my thing. Then I want some answers.  KAY Do your ""thing,"" kid.  Edwards goes inside.  INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT  JACK JEEBS is the sleazy, sarcastic proprietor of the Pawn Shop. He\'s not easily intimidated.  JEEBS Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how\'d these get here? I thought I turned \'em in to the proper authorities.  He casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter.  EDWARDS Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.  JEEBS Sure -- I\'m a big crack dealer now. I just work here because I love the hours.  This pisses Edwards off. He grabs Jeebs by the collar.  EDWARDS (getting angry) I\'m talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech stuff.  JEEBS C\'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.  Kay walks into the room.  KAY Why don\'t you show him the imports, Jeebs.  At the sound of Kay\'s voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face.  JEEBS H-hiya Kay, how are you?  KAY The imports, Jeebs. Now.  JEEBS You know I got outta that business a long time ago, Kay.  KAY Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you lie.  He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs\' forehead.  JEEBS Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...  KAY I\'m going to count to three.  Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine.  EDWARDS He\'ll do it, Jeebs.  KAY One.  EDWARDS I\'ve seen him do it.  KAY Two.  EDWARDS Talk to me, Jeebs, he\'s crazy when he\'s like this.  JEEBS He\'s always crazy. (to Kay) Take a cruise. Get a massage --  KAY Three.  KA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs\' head off and Jeebs\' body collapses to the floor. Edwards is shocked.  Edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay\'s head.  EDWARDS Put down the gun and put your hands on the counter!  KAY I warned him.  EDWARDS Drop the weapon!  KAY You warned him.  EDWARDS You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.  KAY Will you relax?  JEEBS (O.S.) (irritated, in a helium voice)You insensitive prick!  Edwards whirls around to see Jeebs\' BODY, growing another head. Only takes four or five seconds. Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs\' baby-soft new cheek.  JEEBS (CONT\'D) Do you know how much that stings?  KAY Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I\'ll use up another one.  Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk --  -- but this is all alien junk. Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly weapons of all shapes and sizes.  KAY Edwards?  Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs\' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons. He recognizes one.  EDWARDS Uh, this. This is what I saw.  Kay looks at Jeebs, pissed off.  KAY You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid.  JEEBS He looked all right to me.  KAY A carbonizer is an assassin\'s weapon, Jeebs. Who was the target?  JEEBS I don\'t know.  Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.  KAY Jeebs!  JEEBS I don\'t know!  Kay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons.  KAY This is all confiscated. All of it. I want you on the next transport off this rock. Or I\'ll shoot you where it doesn\'t grow back.  Jeebs nods, point taken. Kay leaves.  EDWARDS Yeah. I\'ll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.  Shaken, Edwards follows.  EXT. PAWN SHOP -- NIGHT  Edwards staggers out of the shop, trying to get the day\'s events straight in his head.  KAY Searching for a handle on the moment here? I can\'t help you, kid.  Kay pulls the sunglasses from his pocket and puts them on.  KAY (cont\'d) Only comfort I can offer is my promise that tomorrow morning  you won\'t remember a thing.  EDWARDS That\'s not exactly some shit you just forget.  He shows the Neuralyzer to Edwards.  KAY Ever see one of these?  CUT TO:  INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT  -- the flash dims on EDWARDS and KAY, sitting at a table in a Chinese restaurant.  KAY (finishing a joke) -- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know, but this one\'s eating my popcorn!  He busts out laughing. Edwards, across from him, is completely disoriented. He looks down. There\'s a half-eaten order of broccoli beef and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him.  EDWARDS Huh?  Kay checks his watch.  KAY Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.  EDWARDS Where am I?  KAY See what I mean about tequila? You\'re a bright young man, James. Just lay off the sauce. I\'ll see you tomorrow, nine a.m. sharp.  He gives a business card before leaving the restaurant.  Edward sees the card, it\'s just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card: ""MiB"". Edwards looks at it, puzzled. He turns the card over and sees "" 504 Battery Drive.""  DISSOLVE TO:  EXT. GARAGE - DAY  A pest control van, reading ""Zap Em"", approaches a garage.  INT GARAGE - DAY  The door opens on a garage. The morning light spills on an abundance of cockroaches, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place. An EXTERMINATOR steps inside, carrying a tank of toxic gas.  EXTERMINATOR Well, well, well. Movin\' right in, are we? Think we own the place?  He unfurls a hose from the side of the tank.  EXTERMINATOR(CONT\'D) Got a little eviction notice for you, boys.  He raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the tank. LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.  VOICE (O.S.) Just what exactly do you think you\'re doing?  The Exterminator turns around. EDGAR stands in the doorway to the garage, staring at him disdainfully.  EXTERMINATOR (shrugs) Takin\' care of your pest problem.  EDGAR ""Pest"" problem? ""Pest?""  EXTERMINATOR Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.  Edgar advances on him, slowly.  EDGAR You know, I have noticed an infestation here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum. So convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives.  EXTERMINATOR Well -- yeah. Don\'t you want to get rid of \'em?  EDGAR In the worst way.  Edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Exterminator\'s face with one hand  and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other. He falls dead on the floor.   EXT. GARAGE - DAY  The Zap-Em truck now has the rear door down and the ramp standing. Edgar rolls the flying saucer towards it.  CUT TO:  EXT. MIB BUILDING - DAY  The next morning. EDWARDS, holding the small MIB business card in his hand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the utterly nondescript building in front of him: the ventilation tower of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, which connects Manhattan with Brooklyn.  INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY  EDWARDS steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre room. One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel vent air intake. There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an OLD SECURITY GUARD, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding metal chair halfway across. A symbol resembling an atom nucleus is on the floor.  Edwards walks across the room, his footsteps ECHOING. The Guard looks up.  GUARD Help you?  EDWARDS Maybe, I\'m not sure, see, I got this card --  GUARD Elevator.  And he goes back to his comic book. Edwards, maybe out of nothing more than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator. As he draws close, the elevator doors WHOOSH open, expecting him.  INT. MIB BUILDING - ENTRANCE ELEVATOR - DAY  Edwards steps inside and turns around. The doors close. The elevato moves for a while as Jay stares at the card, and then door on the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him.  From behind him, somebody clears their throat. Edwards turns around, and finds himself standing in --  INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY  This back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway. Standing at the front of the room is ZED, a wire-haired career G-man, an old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last night. SIX OTHER HOT RECRUITS sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at Edwards.  One chair is empty.  ZED You\'re late. Sit down.  Edwards takes the remaining chair. The elevator doors slide shut. Zed continues addressing the Recruits.  ZED (CONT\'D) My name is Zed. You\'re all here because you\'re the best of the best. Marines, Navy SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.  They all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. He gives it back.  ZED (CONT\'D) And we\'re looking for one of you. Just one. What will follow is a series of simple tests designed to quantify motor skills, hand-eye coordination, concentration, stamina -- I see we have a question.  Edwards\'s hand is, indeed, up.  EDWARDS Why, uh -- I\'m sorry, it\'s just no one really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are we doing this?  Silence. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. Zed calls on him.  ZED Son?  AMBITIOUS RECRUIT (loud and formal) Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with honors. We\'re here because you\'re looking for the best of the best of the best, sir!  Edwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can\'t.  ZED What\'s so funny, Edwards?  EDWARDS Your boy, Captain America, here. ""The best of the best of the best, sir!\'\' \'\'With honors.\'\' He\'s just really excited, and he has no clue why we\'re here. That\'s very funny to me. Y\'all ain\'t laughing, though.  EDWARDS Want to get down on this?  ZED Okay. Let\'s get going.  The recruits get the written test. It\'s a thick document -- reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams.  EDWARDS is struggling to just open it: he rips through the first page, and then breaks the pencil trying to break the tape holding it together.  Behind the dark glass, Kay stands, staring, unemotional.  The RECRUITS are all struggling to get a place to write in their chairs, given no desks were provided. One even has his pencil TEAR through the page.  Edwards looks up. In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table. Edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --  -- and drags it, SCREECHING DEAFENINGLY, back to his chair. Everybody looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.  Edwards sits back down, now writing on the table.  That\'s better.  EDWARDS Want to get down on this?  They stare silently.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY  SEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty, triangular room. A claxon rings, and it\'s shown the SEVEN RECRUITS are in front of the table. The two far walls pull apart. The whole room starts being covered in stroboscopic lights, while an urban landscape featuring human and alien carboard figures shows. The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim.  Everyone but Edwards shoots. And then a second later, he fires. The lights come down. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED with it. Even the highly competitive cadets can\'t help but feel some sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards.  ZED The hell happened?  EDWARDS Hesitated, sir.  Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl.  ZED May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?  EDWARDS She was the only one who actually seemed dangerous. At the time.  ZED And how did you come to that conclusion?  EDWARDS First, I was going to pop this guy hanging from the streetlight but I realized he\'s just working out. How\'d I feel if somebody bust me in my ass while I\'m on the treadmill?Then I saw this snarling beast guy, and I noticed he had a tissue in his hand and realized he\'s not snarling, he\'s sneezing -- he\'s got tissues in his hand. Ain\'t no real threat there. Then I saw Tiffany. I\'m thinking, eight-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto... bunch of monsters at night with quantum physics books. She about to start some shit, Zed. She\'s about eight. Those books are way too advanced for her. If you ask me, she\'s up to something.  Honestly, I\'d appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.  Sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs.  EDWARDS (CONT\'D) Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology?  Zed walks away.  EDWARDS That was a good shot though, right?  Uncomfortable looks.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING - OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY  ZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.  ZED He\'s got a real problem with authority.  KAY So do I. But this kid ran down a cephlapoid on foot, boss. That\'s got to be tough enough.  ZED I hope you know what you\'re doing.  Zed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group.  Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off.  ZED (CONT\'D) Congratulations, you\'re everything we\'ve come to expect from years of government training. Now, if you\'ll just follow me, we have one more test to administer, an eye exam.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY  The RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.  KAY is outside the door, waiting for him.  KAY Where are you going?  Edwards recognizes him from last night and walks towards him.  EDWARDS You! Hey, what\'s goin\' on?  Once Edwards approaches, Kay gives him a folder. Both start walking down the corridor.  KAY Back in the mid-fifties, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet.  As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket.  ZED Now, if you\'ll look directly at the end of this device.  He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses.  Edwards then turns to the folder, and starts reading from it. As Kay talks and both walk, Zed\'s neuralyzer FLASHES.  KAY Everybody thought the agency was a joke. Except the aliens. They made contact on March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.  Cut to Edwards\' point of view - the folder has thick with eight by ten photographs. He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and fluorescent lights... and one young man resembling young KAY in a plaid shirt holding a bouquet.  KAY (CONT\'D) There were nine of us that night. Seven agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back road.  Yet another photograph, this one showing the young man  giving the tall alien the flowers.  EDWARDS Oh, you brought that tall man some flowers.  Kay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as the first.  KAY They were intergalactic refugees with a simple request. Let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet.  Ever see ""Casablanca?""  Same thing, no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all evidence of their landing.  Another picture, this one of the 1964 World\'s Fair grounds, still under construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair\'s theme of space travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.  EDWARDS So these are real flying saucers and the World\'s Fair was a cover-up for their landing?  KAY Why else would we hold it in Queens? (another hallway) More nonhumans arrive every year. They live among us, in secret.  EDWARDS I see. Not to change the subject, but when was your last CAT scan?  KAY Every six months; it\'s company policy.  EDWARDS Make another appointment. Tell your boy Zed I had an absolutely wonderful time and thank you for everything but show me the door.  They have stopped next to an unmarked door. Kay throws it open and steps inside.  KAY All right. I\'m going to get some coffee. You want some coffee?  EDWARDS No, thank you, I\'m fine.  As Kay walks into the kitchenette, THREE WORM-LIKE ALIENS standing around a water cooler. Impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of Esperanto and microphone feedback. One holds the coffee pot, another drinks and smokes.  KAY How you doing, fellas?  WORMS Hi Kay!  Kay grabs a paper cup, approaches the one with the pot.  KAY That\'s not decaf, is it?  WORM Viennese cinnamon.  KAY Don\'t tell me we\'ve only got that powdered stuff for cream again?  One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter.  KAY (CONT\'D) Well, that\'s good. Good. Good.  He finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated, dumps some in his coffee.  KAY You guys getting along all right?  They reply in their language.  KAY Don\'t work too hard.  He comes back outside, closing the door behind him.  WORM So, you guys seen the cahuengas on...  Kay approaches the slack-jawed Edwards.  KAY (CONT\'D) Sure you don\'t want coffee?  WORM Cahuengas, yeah, but how about the zapoata?  As the worms laugh, the scene cuts.  CUT TO:  EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY  EDWARDS, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside KAY on a bench in Battery Park. Kay drinks his coffee while they talk.  KAY Any given time, around fifteen hundred landed aliens are on the planet, the majority right here in Manhattan. Most aliens are decent enough, just trying to make a living.  EDWARDS Cab drivers?  KAY Not as many as you\'d think. Humans, for the most part, don\'t have a clue. Don\'t want one, either. They\'re happy. They think they\'ve got a pretty good bead on things.  EDWARDS Why the big secret? People are smart, they can handle it.  KAY A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals. You know it.  A thousand years ago everybody knew Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat. Fifteen minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet.  Imagine what you\'ll know tomorrow.  EDWARDS So what\'s the catch?  KAY The catch.The catch is you will sever every human contact. Nobody will ever know you exist anywhere. Ever. l give you to sunrise to think it over.  Kay gets up and walks away.  EDWARDS Is it worth it?  KAY Yeah, it\'s worth it... if you\'re strong enough.  DISSOLVE TO:  EXT. BATTERY PARK - DUSK  Almost nighttime now, and the park is empty. EDWARDS is still on the bench. And still thinking. Above him, the stars are coming out.  Slowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens.  CUT TO:  EXT. NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING  We are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor.  We see the Zap Em van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY  EDWARDS stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he first came into yesterday. The guard is still there.  EDWARDS What\'s up, pops?  The elevator doors open and KAY, obviously summoned by the OLD SECURITY GUARD, stands waiting for him.  EDWARDS One thing you gotta know right now.  Edwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay.  INT. MIB BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY  Inside the elevator, the doors WHOOSH shut, KAY turns a key in a certain floor number, and the descent begins. EDWARDS continues.  EDWARDS All right. I\'m in because there\'s some next-level shit going on around here, and I\'m with that. Before you beam me up, there are a couple of things we need to get straight. First off, you chose me, so you recognize the skills. I don\'t want nobody calling me ""son"" or ""kid"" or ""sport."" Cool?  KAY Whatever you say, slick. But I need to tell you something about all your skills. As of right now...  The elevator doors --  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY  -- slide open on Men in Black headquarters.  KAY ...they mean precisely dick.  It\'s unlike anything we\'ve ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling, shuffling papers.  KAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out over the whole place.  Kay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking the documents of a line of ALIENS who\'ve just arrived. There are a dozen bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien tongues.  Edwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as he addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor.  PASSPORT OFFICER Purpose of trip?  ARQUILLIAN Diplomatic mission.  PASSPORT OFFICER Duration of stay?  ARQUILLIAN Lunch.  PASSPORT OFFICER Carrying any fruits or vegetables?  As Edwards passes by an alien resembling a giant slub and just stares, fascinated, Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries him along.  KAY Let\'s go. He\'s a little...grouchy.  Kay moves him into the central hall.  KAY Three-hour delay in customs after a 17 trillion mile flight gonna make anybody cranky. Right?  EDWARDS What branch of the government do we report to?  KAY None. They ask too many questions.  EDWARDS So who pays for all this?  KAY Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we confiscated from our out-of-state visitors. Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.  AT A STORAGE CAGE, Kay turns a key in the lock of a caged-in area and throws the door open. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops.  KAY (picking something up) This is a fascinating little gadget. A new recording device to replace CD\'s.  So now I gotta buy the White Album again.  (something else) This is amusing. Universal translator.  He holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like a lapel microphone.  KAY (CONT\'D) We\'re not supposed to have it. I\'ll tell you why.  Human thought is so primitive it\'s looked upon as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies. That kind of makes you proud, doesn\'t it?  Edwards touches up a small yellow ball that stands floating above a torch-like device.  EDWARDS What\'s this?  THE BALL ZINGS OUT OF EDWARDS\' HANDS -- it flies out into the main complex -- hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room, faster than the eye can follow --  VARIOUS SHOTS OF HUMANS AND ALIENS ducking, dodging, and jumping out of its way. One experiment room has all the beakers and such breaking. In Zed\'s office, the boss barely notices the bouncing ball.  EDWARDS (to various people as the ball approaches or hits them) Relax! Watch your head!  Somebody get him some ice.Move! Just move when it\'s coming at you!Damn! I\'m going to pay for that!  ON KAY as he calmly, a little wearily, slips an odd-looking metal glove over his right hand...  He raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it -- Kay catches the ball, calmly.  KAY (CONT\'D) Caused the \'77 New York blackout. Practical joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it was funny as hell.  They leave the room.  EDWARDS Sorry! It was a accident. Sorry.  ON THE MAIN FLOOR, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant screen on the far wall.  KAY Observation, the heart of our little endeavor. Meet the twins. Idikiukup and Bob.  Kay gestures to two small, bony CREATURES with eight arms each and a single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads. They turn around and wave two or three arms each.  The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them.  KAY (CONT\'D) This map shows the location of every registered alien on earth at any given time. Some of them we keep under constant surveillance.  He hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by ten big screens.  KAY (CONT\'D) Everyone on these screens is an alien. In public -- normal. In private -- you\'ll get the idea.  ON THE SCREENS, we see live images of ten humans who are actually aliens.  EDWARDS Oh, man.  KAY It makes no sense?  EDWARDS It makes perfect sense.When I was in third grade, everyone said I was crazy...  but I knew our teacher was from Venus or something like that.  KAY Mrs. Edelson.Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.  Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots ""Irma Edelson""  onto the screen.  EDELSON Class...  be quiet and pay attention! If I have to tell you one more time--  ZED\'s voice is then heard.  ZED (O.S.) Edwards!  Edwards turns around  ZED Let\'s put it on.  EDWARDS Put what on?  ZED The last suit you\'ll ever wear.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY  The MIB locker room is all gray, each locker with a single letter. Edwards approaches a locker reading ""J"". ZED\'S VOICE comes over:  ZED (O.S.) From now on, you\'ll dress only in attire specially sanctioned by MIB Special Services.  EDWARDS takes out revealing a BLACK SUIT hung from a hanger in the middle. Above it, on the shelf, a WHITE SHIRT, a WRISTWATCH and a pair of BLACK SUNGLASSES. On the bottom, a pair of SHINY BLACK SHOES.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY  KAY is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards\'s birth certificate, driver\'s license, social security card, library card, everything.  One by one, KAY deletes Edwards\'s identity cards.  ZED\'S VOICE continues:  ZED (O.S.) You\'ll conform to the identity we give you, eat where we tell you, live where we tell you.  INT. MIB BUILDING LASER BOOTH - DAY  EDWARDS stands in a cramped white booth.  He holds both his hands on a TEN-FINGERED KEYPAD, pressing down hard. The pad glows red, a SEARING sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints.  ZED (O.S.) You will have no identifying marks of any kind.  You will not stand out in any way. Your entire image is carefully crafted to leave no lasting memory whatsoever with anyone you encounter.  INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY   Feet slip into black shoes.  ZED (O.S.) You\'re a rumor, recognizable only as deja vu and dismissed just as quickly. You don\'t exist; you were never even born.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY  On the computer screen is Edwards\' full name -- JAMES DARREL EDWARDS III. Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards\'s name.  The watch is put on the wrist.  ZED (O.S.) Anonymity is your name. Silence your native tongue.  More letters are eliminated from his name. It reads ""JAMES DARREL ED..."" then ""JAMES DARR...""  The glasses are removed and put on the coat\'s pocket.  ZED (O.S.) You are no longer part of ""the system.""  ""JAMES..."" ""JAM...""  ZED (O.S.) We\'re above the system. Over it. Beyond it.  A tie pushed up. The earring is removed.  ZED (O.S.) We\'re ""them."" We\'re ""they.""  On screen, all that\'s left is the letter ""J.""  ZED (O.S.) We are the Men in Black.  Kay\'s screen reads ""New Entry: J. Database Updated"" as the atom logo shows in the background. Jay\'s voice is heard.  JAY (O.S.) The difference between you and me?  Kay moves. Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, JAMES D EDWARDS III -- or, rather, JAY -- reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and slips \'em on.  JAY (CONT\'D) I make this look good.  CUT TO:  EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  Out of one of the ""Rosenberg Fine Jewelry"" shops on Thirty-Fifth Street comes a short, old man (ROSENBERG), carrying a bag with a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box. He talks to the cat.  ROSENBERG We\'re going to go for a ride. I\'ll put you down here for a minute then Daddy will be right back.  Carefully, he puts the bag on a pane with flowers as he locks the revolving door to his distinctive shop.  The Zap-Em Truck then approaches the shop. The cat stares at Edgar as he struggles to position itself in a ""not-suspicious"" position.  ROSENBERG Okay, now we\'re ready to go for a little ride.  That finished, Rosenberg picks up the bag, puts the box in his pocket, then waddles off down the street.  ROSENBERG We\'re going to meet with Daddy\'s friend who you\'ll like.  Edgar then starts the van and moves it along.  INT. MIB BUILDING - ZED\'S OFFICE - DAY  Zed\'s office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are six video monitors on a wall behind Zed\'s desk, and on each monitor is another Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image.  While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk.  ZED Okay, let\'s see. (to one of the monitors) Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of Sinalee touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight.  BEE, an agent on one of the monitors, nods.  BEE Humanoid?  ZED You wish. Bring a sponge. (going through memos) And here. Red-letter from last night -- we had an un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate New York farm country. Keep your ears open for this one, Kay, we\'re not hosting a galactic kegger down here.  Next to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly.  Zed looks over at it.  ZED Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.  KAY (to Jay) Landed alien out of zone. (to Zed) Who is it?  ZED Redgick. He\'s not cleared to leave Manhattan but he\'s way out of town right now, stuck in traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why don\'t you take junior with you? This is a good one for him to warm up on.  Kay gets up.  ZED (to Jay) Go get \'em, Tiger.  Zed then looks again that the monitor reporting on Redgick.  EXT. MIB BUILDING - BATTERY PARK - DAY  JAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters.  JAY (imitating Zed) ""We\'re not hosting an intergalactic kegger...""  Kay frowns at him.  JAY Zed. He just...  An MIB MECHANIC pulls up in Kay\'s black LTD and hops out, leaving the door open. Jay sizes up the car.  JAY Unlimited technology from the whole universe... and we cruise around in a Ford P.O.S.  INT. MIB LTD - DAY  They get in and slam the doors. Kay fastens his seatbelt.  KAY Fasten seat belt.  He  starts the car and the engine HUMS quietly.  JAY We got to work on your people skills. You\'d get a much better reaction if you were more polite.  Kay shifts on reverse, glares at Jay and extends his hands above the wheel.  KAY Fasten seat belts, please.  JAY Good. Did you hurt yourself?  Kay steps on the gas. The awesome power of the car kicks in and Jay sails forward, THWACKING into the dash. Kay shifts into forward and taps the gas, SLAMMING Jay back into his seat.  Jay\'s hand falls by accident on a lever between the seats, with a big red button on it.  KAY Oh, the red button there. Don\'t ever, ever touch it.  Jay jerks his hand away.  CUT TO:  EXT. R&L RESTAURANT - DAY  The exterior of R&L, a Russian diner. A cab stops on the door, ROSENBERG steps out of it.  CAB DRIVER All right, pop,that\'ll be $72   there.  Rosenberg puts the bag with the cat atop the taxi.  ROSENBERG Okay, sweetie, let me pay the impolite driver.  A moment later, the Zap-Em van pulls to a stop across the street.  INT. LESHKO\'S DINER - DAY  ROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid fifties. The man (an ARQUILLIAN, and if we\'re eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien on a ""diplomatic mission"" from passport control) rises from his chair.  Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, puts the bag on the floor, but does not sit down. He and ROSENBERG embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion.  Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled.  ROSENBERG Sorry I\'m late. The cab drivers on this planet are terrible.  ARQUILLIAN Your majesty, you are in grave danger.  ROSENBERG Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.  ARQUILLIAN Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off the planet.  ROSENBERG A bug? He must know why I\'m here.  ARQUILLIAN We think he does.(noticing the ornate box on the table) Is that what I think it is?  ROSENBERG No, just some diamonds for your children. Do we have time to eat?  The Arquillian relaxes.  ARQUILLIAN Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.  INT. LESHKO\'S DINER - KITCHEN - DAY  In the kitchen, the Russian COOK slaps two orders of pirogi up on the stainless steel counter --  COOK Table six is up!  He sees someone approaching...  COOK Where is Ivan?  VOICE (O.S.) Gave him a break.  The voice is suspiciously like Edgar\'s. The cook turns away to his grill. A HAND reaches in, takes the plates, one with each hand. We follow, but see only the arm and aproned midsection of the waiter carrying it.  As he steps away, we see a storage shelf crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed tomatoes --  -- and the DEAD IVAN, literally folded in half and stuffed in among the shelves.  INT. LESHKO\'S DINER - DAY  ROSENBERG and the ARQUILLIAN raise their glasses in a toast. Now it\'s clear that the waiter approaching in the background is Edgar.  ARQUILLIAN To the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire.  ROSENBERG To the safety of the galaxy.  They CLINK glasses and drink, just as Edgar arrives. The plates are put down. Close in on Rosenberg\'s, from his POV, catching a glimpse of the Waiter\'s hand --  -- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter\'s sleeve and scurries in the dish. Rosenberg looks up to the waiter\'s face, paralyzed with fear. He seems to know what dire implications Edgar\'s presence holds.  ROSENBERG (in English again) You can kill us both -- but you will not find it.  The Arquilian looks at Edgar, is also afraid. Rosenberg\'s cat is seen  raising his head on the bag.  EDGAR You\'re right about one thing.  Suddenly a long STINGER whips out from under the back of Edgar\'s apron and zips under the table. It hits Rosenberg\'s neck, and then the Arquillian. Both lurch forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain. They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi.  Edgar moves quickly, grabs the ornate box, and leaves, flipping a table on the way. Rosenberg\'s cat leaps back onto the table and SNARLS at him as he goes. He turns around and grunts at the cat, who proceeds to angrily make a defying gesture. We can see his collar reads ""ORION"" before the cat hisses again.  Edgar turns around and walks further towards the exit. Another waiter moves to the  door frame.  MAN You\'re not going anywhere, pal.  Edgar tosses him away, making the waiter\'s tray loudly fall and make noise. Edgar then pushes the door and walks down the street, with the patron next to the door staring.  PASSERBY What\'s going on?  Edgar just hits and makes the man fall.  EXT. R&L RESTAURANT - DAY Edgar is walking down the street, holding his hip and stretching his arm. The restaurant staff are all gathering at the door to stare at him, as does another man passing by the street.  INT. LESHKO\'S DINER - DAY The cat stares angrily.  CUT TO:  EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY  A car has pulled over. KAY  approaches the DRIVER.  KAY License and registration, please.  The Driver hands over some documents.  KAY (O.S.) Other license and registration, please.  The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Jay peers over Kay\'s shoulder.  KAY You\'re restricted to Manhattan. Where are you going, Redgie?  REDGICK It\'s my wife! She\'s -- she\'s -- well, look!  It can be seen the back seat that MRS. REDGICK, with a big belly, lies down, MOANING in pain, making contraction gestures.  KAY All right. No big deal.  He opens the door.  KAY (cont\'d) Okay, you come with me, Redge.  Redgwick steps out the car, looks at his screaming wife one last time. Kay closes the door, turns to Jay.  KAY You handle it.  JAY What? Me?  Kay approaches Redgwick.  KAY Sure, it\'s easy, you just sorta -- catch.  REDGICK He knows what he\'s doing?  KAY He does it all the time. Let the man work.  INT. REDGWICK\'S CAR - DAY  From Mrs. Redgwick\'s point of view, her open legs and Jay outside the door.  He smiles, gestures happily, and then does an imitation of the ""breathing lesson in Lamaze class"". Then he looks down to the woman\'s crotch...  JAY Kay! Damn, man! So-- Something\'s peaking!  EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY A few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him. The car has all sorts of stuff above the trunk, so nothing inside the cabin can be seen. A TENTACLE whips out from inside the car, wraps around Jay and pulls him. He struggles trying to get released. The other two never break their conversation.  KAY Croagg the Midwife\'s back on 64th and 8th. You were headed out of town.  REDGICK Well, we\'re, uh -- meeting someone.  KAY (still to Redgick) So? Who you meeting?  REDGICK Well, it\'s -- a ship.  KAY Really? I didn\'t see a departure clearance for today.  REDGICK You didn\'t? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.  The tentacle starts dangling Jay upside down above the car.  JAY Kay! Kay!  KAY You\'re doing fine, ace.  JAY Kiss my ass!  KAY (back to Redgick) What kind of emergency? What\'s the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden?  Jay is pulled inside the car. And then as the vehicle shakes he emerges still wrapped on the tentacle through the other side.  REDGICK We just don\'t like the neighborhood anymore. Some of the -- new arrivals.  Jay starts being bashed on the car ceiling.  KAY New arrivals? Have anything to do with the crasher from last night?  Redgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes away. Jay is pulled inside the car again.  JAY (Screaming) Excuse me, miss! But in that moment, Jay is ejected with great speed from inside the car. Redge runs towards him. Jay falls, flat on his back in the dirt, the multi-tentacled squidlike baby resting squarely on his chest.  JAY (CONT\'D) Oh -- oh -- oh -- man.  Kay and Redgwick approach. Kay claps him on the back.  KAY Congratulations, Redge! It\'s a squid.  Jay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest.  JAY (misty) He\'s... actually kind of...  It vomits slime on him. Jay spits the one that fell in his mouth, and then the ""squid"" blinks.  JAY ...cute.  CUT TO:  EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIB LTD - DAY  Back in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY starts up the car.  KAY Anything about that seem unusual to you?  Jay just looks at him, very Jack Benny.   KAY What kind of ""new arrival"" would scare Redgick so bad that he\'d risk a warp jump with a newborn? (thinks) Let\'s check the hot sheets.  EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY  CLOSE ON on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them. There are headlines like ""POPE A FATHER!""and ""TOP DOCTORS BAFFLED -- BABY BORN PREGNANT!"" and ""MAN EATS OWN HOUSE!"" (the subhead on that one is ""And That\'s Just the Appetizer, Says Neighbor."")  KAY and JAY are at a downtown newsstand. Kay is furiously searching through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed.  JAY These are the hot sheets?  Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a buck.  KAY Best investigative reporting on the planet.  Read the New York Times if you want. They get lucky sometimes.  JAY I cannot believe you\'re looking for tips in a supermarket tabloid.  KAY Not looking for. Found.  He SMACKS the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming:  Farm wife says ""ALIEN STOLE MY HUSBAND\'S SKIN!""  CUT TO:  EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY  The LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to Beatrice\'s farmhouse, where the alien ship landed. The wrecked pickup truck is still there. JAY and KAY get out, very undercover cop. Jay starts up the driveway.  KAY Wait, slow down.  JAY Why?  KAY Give her time to get the wrong impression. Makes things smoother.  BEATRICE appears in the door to the house, curious.  Beatrice calls to them.  BEATRICE Can I help you gentlemen?  KAY How do you do, ma\'am, I\'m Special Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a few questions about your visitor.  BEATRICE Are you here to make fun of me too?  KAY No ma\'am. We at the FBI don\'t have a sense of humor that we\'re aware of. Mind if we come in?  BEATRICE Sure. Lemonade?  CUT TO:  INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY  Beatrice speaks sitting on the couch.  BEATRICE The chief of police himself come up to the house and did a full-out professional investigation. Took a police report and writ down everything I said... from A to Z, not believing one thing I said. Sort of poking fun at me. And they said to me, ""If he was murdered, how could he walk back in the house?""  JAY sips some of her lemonade and winces, before spitting it back.  BEATRICE And I gotta admit, I was a little stumped by that one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn\'t him.  Kay is nodding, while Jay checks out the room. He puts the glass on the table, and picks up a  framed PHOTO OF EDGAR  BEATRICE It was more like something else that was wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.  A GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay pokes Kay, shows him the picture with Edgar proudly holding his shotgun in the middle of the bog.  JAY Dude was that ugly before he was an alien.  BEATRICE I\'m sorry.  KAY Go on.  BEATRICE Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.  KAY Did he say anything?  BEATRICE Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I remember.  KAY Sugar water.  Kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Jay puts his as well.  BEATRICE Yeah, I remember that right. \'Cause I thought that was odd. That he asked me for sugar water and not lemonade or ice water or... regular water or... tap water.  Kay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead as if hypnotized. Kay takes his glasses off, Jay follows.  KAY Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn\'t a UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus --  JAY Wait a minute. You flash that thing, it erases her memory and you just make up a new one?  KAY Standard issue neuralyzer.  JAY That weak-ass story is the best you can come up with?  KAY All right. On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at your mother\'s for a few days and get over it. Decide you\'re better off.  JAY (butting in) Well, yeah, because he never appreciated you anyway. Okay. You know what? (points at Beatrice) You. Kicked. Him. Out. Alright? Now you\'re gonna do what he said, you\'re gonna go stay with your mother. Then you\'re gonna go get yourself some new dresses, some new shoes, maybe go somewhere where you can get a facial. (looks around the house) Oh, and I\'d hire a decorator to come in here quick because, damn.  CUT TO:  EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY  KAY is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. He holds a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  The analyzer shifts colors.  Red. Then Yellow.  JAY (from up outside the hole) Yo, Kay, check it out. When do I get my own flashy memory messer-upper thing?  KAY When you grow up.  Jay scratches his eyebrow with his middle finger. Kay returns to stare at the analyzer.  KAY Please -- not green.  Purple. And then green.  KAY (CONT\'D) Damn.  Kay stands up.  KAY (CONT\'D) I don\'t suppose you know what kind of alien life form leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water, do you?  JAY Uh, wait, that was on ""Final Jeopardy!"" last night. Damn, Alex said...  Kay snatches up a cellphone.  KAY Zed, we have a bug.  He turns off the radio and starts walking out the hole.  JAY So. What? We don\'t like bugs?  KAY Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They consume, infest and destroy. They live off the death and decay of other species.  JAY You were stung as a child, right?  KAY Imagine a giant cockroach with unlimited strength, a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper is tear-assing around Manhattan Island in a brand new Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?  JAY What\'s the move?  KAY With the bug in town, we watch the morgues.  CUT TO:  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  The stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police headquarters. ROSENBERG\'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with ""City Morgue"" written across them. The words split in half as the stretcher BANGS through the doors.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  The city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses parked left and right. Busy day in the Apple. The Cop wheeling the stretcher calls out to the CORONER, who\'s hunched over another body.  COP Where do you want contestant number three?  The coroner turns around. It\'s DR. LAUREL WEAVER, the woman who tried to speak to Jay before. She sighs and waves a hand.  LAUREL By the wall, I guess. (noticing) What\'s with the cat?  COP Oh, the cat. There\'s a problem with the cat. Sign here.  Laurel signs his clipboard.  LAUREL What\'s the problem with the cat?  COP Your problem.  Laurel gives him a dirty look as he leaves.  LAUREL I hate the living.  She goes over to the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg\'s cat gently.  LAUREL Shall we?  She wheels the stretcher under the lights.  INT. MORGUE - LATER - DAY  The Arquilian is in an open drawer of the  cold chambers, while Laurel is hunched over Rosenberg\'s corpse. Fascinated by something, she digs deeper. And deeper. And looks up, her face a mixture of alarm and excitement.  LAUREL Oh, my God. Buddy, what are you?  CUT TO:  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT  Two men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside the morgue. They hasten down the hallway, their shoes CLICKING in perfect lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end.  JAY and KAY. Men in Black on a mission.  INT. MORGUE - NIGHT  In her darkened office, LAUREL is on her desk, recording her report.  LAUREL (into recorder) Subject was approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a post-mortem increase in body temperature. Examiner attempted to verify result rectally, only to find subject was, uh, without rectum. Which can only be described  as...well...as really...  KAY (O.S.) Weird?  Kay turns on the lights.  KAY (cont\'d) Dr. Leo Menville, Department of Public Health. This is Dr. White.  LAUREL (checking her watch) You boys must not have much of a home life.  KAY We watch the morgues very carefully. You\'ve got something unusual?  LAUREL I\'d say so -- triple homicide.  She gets up and takes them to the cold chambers.  LAUREL (CONT\'D) The first corpse was perfectly normal, except that he was broken in half, but when I opened up the other two -- well, look.  She pulls back a drawer, revealing a body covered in a sheet.  LAUREL (CONT\'D) There\'s a skeletal structure at work here unlike anything I\'ve ever seen.  Pulling the sheet from the face reveals the Arquillian.  KAY I\'ll have a look at this one. Dr. White, why don\'t you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body?  LAUREL This way, Doctor.  Jay and Laurel cross the room, to where ROSENBERG\'s corpse lies out on another gurney.  LAUREL (CONT\'D) This one\'s even stranger. I did a full laparotomy. I started with the lesser curvature of the stomach -- though, if you want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal junction.  JAY I think, uh, we should start at the same place you did.  LAUREL All right.  She pulls out a glove box, hands Jay one and puts on the other. Rosenberg\'s cat steps on Jay\'s shoe.  JAY Your cat?  LAUREL Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies. Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won\'t mind.  Jay is reluctant and retches, but puts his hand on the hole.  LAUREL (CONT\'D) You have very pretty eyes.  JAY Thank you.  Laurel continues to guide him on the thick of the corpse.  LAUREL (CONT\'D) Feel that? Where the piloric junction would be?  JAY Oh, yes. Exactly.  LAUREL Now push that aside. Notice anything strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?  JAY Nope. All fine.  LAUREL Doctor, they\'re all missing.  JAY (quickly) Well, of course they are. What I\'m pointing out is that there are no pieces of them left. So they\'re intact, wherever they are. That we can be sure of.  LAUREL Have we met before? I have the strangest feeling of deja vu.  JAY Yeah, me too.  LAUREL Really? Okay. You wanna know what I really think? (re: Kay) But don\'t tell that guy. He looks like he\'s already under enough stress. (then) This body is not really a body, but it\'s actually some sort of transport unit for something else altogether. The question is: what?  Jay just looks at her intrigued.  LAUREL Is this freaking you out?  JAY No, girl.  After a particularly gross GUSHY sound, he looks away, toward her. She\'s staring at him.  Laurel leans over and lowers her voice, just for him.  LAUREL You know what I like to do sometimes? When it\'s really late?  JAY (intrigued) No...  As she starts talking...  KAY Doctor White...  Laurel just flips her hair as the chat is interrupted.  JAY (CONT\'D) Excuse me.  She nods positively. He walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian. But Jay never takes his eyes off Laurel.  KAY What do you think?  JAY (of Laurel) Very interesting.  She got a real Queen of the Undead thing goin\' on.  KAY Of the body.  JAY Great body.  KAY The dead body?  JAY Man, you have to look at that thing.  LAUREL (O.S.) Dr. White.  KAY (pointing at the Arquillian) Recognize him?  JAY Yeah, he looks like the big guy I saw down at headquarters, only deader.  LAUREL (CONT\'D) (louder) Dr. White.  KAY What do you think killed him?  JAY A bug?  Jay, in conversation with Kay, does not respond to what is not his name. Laurel enters the frame.  LAUREL (shouting) DR. WHITE!  Kay nudges Jay.  KAY You\'re up, Slugger.  Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her.  LAUREL Look at this.  Jay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg\'s ear.  JAY What the hell is that?  He reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft CLICK --  -- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch.  Jay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and Rosenberg\'s entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial skull.  A TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG\'S HEAD.  Though not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg\'s head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.  The Tiny Little Green Man forces words out of his mouth.  ""ROSENBERG"" Must -- to pre -- prevent -- -- contest?  JAY It\'s all right -- What are you trying to say? Struggle?  LAUREL War?  The Green Man nods vigorously. That\'s it.  BALTIAN (faltering) Galaxy is on -- or -- or -- Orion\'s -- Be-Be... What is word?  JAY Bed? Belt? Orion\'s Belt?  The Green man nods again, falls, and dies. The cat staring from above meows in sadness. Jay and Laurel look at the little dead alien, then at each other.  JAY (CONT\'D) ""To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion\'s Belt?""  The hell does that mean? (turns around) Hey! Dr., uh, whatever, come here!  Kay begins over. Laurel looks at them.  LAUREL ""Doctor Whatever""? You\'re not with the Department of Public Health, are you?  Kay looks at the mess -- the body, the little dead man.  KAY Rosenberg. Ah, damn. The Arquillians will not like this. He was one of the royal family.  Laurel smiles.  LAUREL I knew it. This is an alien. And you\'re from some government agency who wants to keep it under wraps...  Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel.  JAY He said ""to prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion\'s Belt.""  Kay puts on his glasses, Jay follows as Kay starts adjusting the neuralyzer.  LAUREL ... This make total sense. How else do you explain New York? The other night I\'m in a cab, this guy...  FLASH! Kay blanks her out.  KAY ""Galaxy on Orion\'s Belt"" doesn\'t make sense.  JAY That\'s what the little dude inside the big dude\'s head said. Right after... (seeing the dazed Laurel) Damn, man, you did the flashy thing already.  LAUREL (as if awakening) Whoever you guys are,  you have to show ID if you\'re going to be in the morgue.  Kay puts on the glasses again.  KAY Of course, young lady. Look at this for me, please.  FLASH! He neuralyzes her again, Jay struggling to put the glasses quickly. Jay slaps his hand.  JAY Would you stop that?  KAY What?  JAY That thing is gonna give her brain cancer or something!  KAY Never hurt her before. We have to close all the doors here. Special Services will be here any minute.  They start walking away.  JAY ""Never hurt her before""?! How many times have you done the flashy thing to this poor woman?!  KAY (evasive) Couple.  JAY Aren\'t you worried about, you know, long term damage?  KAY (more evasive) Little.  JAY Have you ever flashy-thinged me?  KAY Nah.  JAY I ain\'t playin\' with ya! Have ya?  KAY No.  EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT  Jay and Kay exit the morgue and walk towards their car.  JAY I think I should be in charge of the flashy thing department.  KAY Not while I\'m around, ace.  JAY You won\'t be happy till you fricassee someone\'s brain out.  An MIB containment vehicle pulls up, and two men dressed in black suits get out.  KAY (to an MIB Agent) We\'ve got two dead aliens in there, and a deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory.  AGENT Yes, sir.  Jay stares at him.  KAY Make it a happy memory.  CUT TO:  INT. ZAP EM VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT  The Zap Em van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside, throaty WAILS of frustration can be heard.  Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR\'s repeated attempts to claw his way into it.  He BELLOWS in rage and it finally CRACKS a hinge. Edgar snaps it up, and wrenches the top off the box.  Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty.  Edgar gets angry.  CUT TO:  EXT. ZAP EM VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT  The van shakes as Edgar wallows.  EDGAR WHERE IS IT?!  CUT TO:  EXT. MIB BUILDING - MAGIC HOUR  As lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING  Despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast.  Kay is in a computer, slightly disheveled. On the screen, some sort of database search software. He types ""RESTON, ELIZABETH ANN"" on name, ""TRURO"". The image changes to a satellite view of North America, while the word ""SEARCHING"" blinks, encouraging patience. The printout changes to ""SUBJECT ACQUIRED."" It quickly zooms in on the Northeast.  Kay types some more. On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Massachusetts. As Kay types some more, Jay\'s voice is heard.  JAY (OS) Hey, Zed.  Jay appears holding a cup of coffee.  JAY Doesn\'t anybody believe in sleep around here?  ZED The twins keep us on Centaurian time -- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months -- you\'ll get used to it. Or you\'ll have a psychotic episode.  The large screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION ORION.  ZED Here\'s Orion; the brightest grouping of stars in the northern sky... (pointing) and here\'s Orion\'s belt --  He indicates the three stars that make up the belt.  JAY That\'s what the little guy was talking about, ""To prevent war, the galaxy\'s on Orion\'s belt...""  ZED There are no galaxies on Orion\'s belt. The belt is just these three stars; galaxies are huge, made up of billions of stars. You heard wrong.  JAY Look, whatever, I know what I heard.  Back to Kay, the computer zooms, then a city, then a neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, the ""Elizabeth Ann Reston"", is tending to her garden. Whoever she is, she\'s lovely. Kay smiles as  Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she\'s being watched, but she\'s just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars\'ll be out tonight. He then types and the image freezes on her face. Jay is standing behind him.  JAY Pretty lady...  Kay clicks something, the software blackens and goes ""Subject Lost"". Jay drags a chair and sits down, sipping his coffee, as Kay rearranges his desk.  JAY (CONT\'D) The grumpy guy\'s story is starting to come into focus a little bit here. You were the guy in the picture you showed me with the flowers.  And, I take it, she never got those flowers.   KAY No.  JAY (CONT\'D) So, what, she ever get married or anything?  KAY No.  Jay looks at him: ""Is this me in thirty years?"" Kay rolls his eyes.  JAY Well, it\'s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.  KAY Try it.   ZED (O.S.) Kay.  Kay gets up, Jay follows, up to Zed in the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering LIGHT.  Some lights are starting to go out.  ZED We\'ve had twelve jumps in the last hour. Redgick was just the beginning.  JAY What do they know that we don\'t know?  Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Another light flickers out.  KAY Why do rats desert the ship? (to the twins) Go to Lem Sat IV with a proton induction thermoscan, please.  ON THE SCREEN Earth changes to a green radar-like diagram.  KAY (CONT\'D) Thank you. Okay, Lem Sat XVIII.  Now there\'s a view of the earth from space. Nothing unusual.  KAY (CONT\'D) All right, four thousand.  Now we\'re looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see something that doesn\'t belong in this picture:  A BATTLE CRUISER far off to one side of the earth.  KAY (CONT\'D) That\'s an Arquillian battle cruiser.  ZEED And we\'ve got a dead Arquillian prince.  A COMMUNICATION STARTS COMING OVER THE SPEAKERS -- a sound like a cat and mouse caught in a blender.  KAY Speak of the devil.  The communication continues.  KAY (CONT\'D) They sound pissed.  The communication continues.  ZED (to the twins) Boys, translate that and step on it! (to Kay) Go to Rosenberg\'s store and see what you can turn up.  Kay and Jay walk away.  ZED (CONT\'D) And Kay -- Give the kid a weapon.  Zed glances back to see the huge gun turrets on the Arquillian Battle Cruiser HUM and WHIR as they swing around into position, pointed down at the unwitting planet below.  IN THE EQUIPMENT LOCKER Kay pulls out the ENORMOUS, MANY-BARRELED SHOTGUN.  KAY Series four de-atomizer.  JAY I like that.  Kay pulls out another weapon, the TINIEST GUN WE\'VE EVER SEEN.  KAY (CONT\'D) ""Noisy Cricket.""  JAY Kay, no, no, come on, man. You get a series four de-atomizer and I get a ""Midget Cricket?!""  Kay panics and pushes Jay\'s hand away as he almost points the gun at him.  JAY (CONT\'D) (looks at the gun) I\'m afraid I\'m going to break it.  INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  Out the window behind him, we can see the Zap-Em van, double parked in the street in front. SMASH! EDGAR smashes the revolving door of Rosenberg\'s jewelry shop. EDGAR steps inside.  All the gems and jewels are under glass counters. Edgar starts SMASHING the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside.  Edgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed pictures on the walls. He stops at one particular picture, staring intently at it. It\'s Rosenberg a glamor shot of Rosenberg\'s cat, provocatively posed on a satin pillow. There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some posed with Rosenberg, some by itself. This animal was important to Rosenberg.  Edgar retches, as if got to some conclusion. From outside, the ROAR of an engine distracts Edgar. He turns around, in time to see the van lurch as a tow truck lifts its front wheels off the ground.  EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  EDGAR rushes outside as the tow truck DRIVER gets the van up on the hoist.  EDGAR Hey, that\'s my truck!  DRIVER And make sure you tell them that at the impound.  Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve gauge. He points it at the tow truck Driver. The tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun.  DRIVER (CONT\'D) Please...  He keeps hitching up the van. The MiB car parks nearby, JAY and KAY enter the ramsacked jewelry shop.  INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  They look around and see the recent demolition caused by Edgar. Jay furrows his brow.  JAY Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the jewels?  KAY Someone who\'s not looking for jewels.  Jay moves behind the counter. On the wall there is an ornate locker full of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS, and several PHOTOS OF A CAT on the wall.  JAY This guy had a serious crush on his cat.  Jay\'s attention is broken by a gunshot. Outside, EDGAR, the farmer\'s rifle and the driver\'s shotgun, heads for the tow truck.  Jay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face?  Jay points the Noisy Cricket at him and YELLS...  JAY Kay! GET DOWN!  And then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar is driving down the street as Jay picks himself up, passing by a Kay that\'s lying down, covered in glass shards.  JAY Man! That\'s him. That\'s the bug! In the Edgar suit!  Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar.  Kay runs out after Jay.  EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  Jay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into some garbage, while his SHOT...  Hits the rigging between the Zap-Em  Van and the town truck, separating the two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it accelerates too quickly.  Edgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire.  JAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through the air and CRASHING through the window of a parked car.  Kay appears and  yanks Jay out of the car.  KAY We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public.  JAY Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There\'s an Alien Battle Cruiser that\'s gonna blow-up the world if we don\'t...  KAY There\'s always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet, and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they don\'t know about it.  Kay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the store. There\'s smoking rubble everywhere.  KAY Don\'t worry about the bug. He\'s not leaving town. We\'ve got his ship.  After gesturing to the back of the Zap-Em van, where Edgar\'s spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone.  KAY (into phone) Zed, we\'re gonna need a containment crew down here at McDougal, south of Houston.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY  Back at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map which indicate aliens\' locations are going out, one by one, about one every five or ten seconds. A WARNING BUZZER is sounding, over and over, and HUMAN STAFFERS are rushing left and right.  ZED is in his office.  ZED Containment may be a moot point, my friend. The exodus continues. It\'s like the party\'s over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.  Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor.  ZED You sorry little ingrates!  The worms dismiss Zed, and then start singing a melody similar to the ""Star-Spangled Banner"".  KAY (O.S.) What about the Arquillians?  ZED We\'ve only translated a part of the message so far: ""Deliver the Galaxy.""  KAY (O.S.) No, they don\'t want much, do they?  ZED Oh, it gets better... They\'re holding us responsible.  He looks up at the screen. It reads: MIB DELIVER THE GALAXY.  Cut to: EXT. UPTOWN NEWSSTAND - DAY  The tow truck SQUEALS to a halt at a curb.  EDGAR gets out and walks away, fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar.  EDGAR Where do you keep your dead?  VENDOR (thinks) I don\'t have any dead.  EDGAR Where?!  VENDOR I don\'t know, the city morgue!  Edgar shoves him away roughly. But before he leaves, his eye catches a postcard display marked ""LANDMARKS OF THE NEW YORK CITY AREA."" Edgar stares, fascinated, but we don\'t see what he\'s looking at. He reaches out and picks up a color postcard.  He raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and hurries off.  VENDOR That\'s three for a dollar, sir!  Cut to: EXT. NEW YORK STREET (OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE)  As a crowd gathers around the Zap-Em Van, Jay tries using the standard cover-up...  JAY It was some light that refracted off of Venus... into some swamp gas... and that\'s what made the--  KAY (O.S.) All right, kid.  Jay starts walking towards Kay.  JAY Excuse me! What\'s up?  KAY (O.S.) The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means.  Jay and Kay are seen walking away from the wreckage, while the MIB clean-up van arrives.  KAY We need help. A professional. Someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics. I just hope the little prick hasn\'t skipped town.  The crowd near gathers near the new vehicle as one agent in a shiny suit with his neuralyzer out shouts in a bullhorn.  CLEAN-UP AGENT May I have your attention? Thank you. If you\'ll gather over here. That\'s right, move in closer. That\'s good. If you look right here, I\'d appreciate it. Thank you.  CUT TO:  EXT. STREET - KEY KIOSK - DAY  Kay\'s LTD SCREECHES to a halt in front of the kiosk on Orchard Street. JAY and KAY leap out and Jay spots the VENDOR on the counter. He\'s wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face aquiver with ticks and mannerisms. He has a small dog in front of him.  Jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter.  JAY Of course that guy\'s an alien. That\'s gotta be the worst disguise I\'ve ever seen.  A voice answers him, but not the Vendor\'s.  FRANK THE PUG You don\'t like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.  Jay looks down. The voice is coming from the dog. This is FRANK THE PUG. Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to make sure no one hears.  KAY You busy, Frank?  FRANK THE PUG Sorry, Kay, I can\'t talk right now, my ride\'s leaving in --  Kay grabs Frank. He yelps like, well, a dog.  FRANK THE PUG Hey! Get your paws off me!  KAY Call the pound. We got a stray.  PASSERBYS glare at Kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor little dog. Jay tries to explain.  JAY The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.  KAY (to Frank) Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?  FRANK THE PUG I know nothing.  KAY Not a thing?  Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer.  FRANK THE PUG Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn\'t some two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of a galaxy. They thought he would be safe here on earth.  KAY And the bug had other plans.  FRANK THE PUG The galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe. If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the Arquillians goodbye.  JAY Ask him about the belt.  KAY (to Frank) Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on ""Orion\'s belt."" What\'s he talking about, Frank?  FRANK THE PUG Beats me.  Kay shakes Frank the Pug once more.  JAY (to a person passing by) They\'re rehearsing a ventriloquist act.  FRANK THE PUG The galaxy is here.  KAY Here?  JAY The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and planets? How\'s it here?  If a dog can smirk, Frank does.  FRANK THE PUG You humans, when\'re you gonna learn that size doesn\'t matter? Just \'cause something\'s important, doesn\'t mean it\'s not very, very small.  KAY How small?  FRANK THE PUG Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel. Now if you\'ll excuse me, I need to be walked before the flight.  Kay lets go of Frank, turns to Jay, who is lost in thought.  KAY (to Frank the Pug) Get out of here. (then to Jay) The galaxy\'s here. It\'s not on Orion\'s belt.  Jay suddenly notices Frank the Pug bark at a cat farther down the sidewalk.  JAY Kay...  CUT TO:  INT. MORGUE - DAY  In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG\'S CAT leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she\'s studying.  Laurel jumps.  LAUREL Boy, when you want attention --  She pets the cat. As she does, the cat\'s collar shines in the light. Laurel turns the name tag to face her.  CLOSE ON A PRECIOUS JEWEL, AND THE WORD ""ORION.""  As it is written across the collar of the cat.  LAUREL (O.S) ""Orion."" That\'s a pretty name.  From out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING.  Laurel notices something dangling from the cat\'s collar -- a marble that has a glowing thing inside it.  LAUREL (CONT\'D) What\'s this?  She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement.  LAUREL Wow.  INT. ICON - DAY  It\'s as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield.  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  Edgar enters the morgue, shotgun in one hand. He gets to the bell on the countertop, BANGS it over and over. Orion hisses, and rushes inside the morgue. The morgue attendant, TONY, emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas Shrugged and a fly swatter.  TONY Thank you for making sure the bell works.  Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY. Edgar winces.  TONY (CONT\'D) (to Edgar) What\'s up, Farmer John?  EDGAR A man came in here earlier. A dead man.  TONY And this means what to me?  EDGAR He was a very dear friend of mine. And I believe he had an animal with him. A gift I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to me. I would like it back.  TONY I\'ll need a picture ID, written proof of ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of kinship with --  WHACK! Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its maker. Edgar grits his teeth.  TONY (CONT\'D) -- the deceased.  EDGAR Don\'t -- do that.  WHACK! Still another fly goes down.  TONY Do what?  EDGAR Don\'t -- do it.  Tony looks down, to where Edgar\'s hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve.  TONY (CONT\'D) Oh, man!  He ducks under the counter --  -- and comes up with two cans of bug spray. Edgar exhales an inhuman growl, and the terrified face of Tony is seen before we...  CUT TO:  EXT. MORGUE - DAY  Kay\'s LTD pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and JAY and KAY jump out.  JAY Look, Kay, let me handle this one.  KAY What?  JAY All we gotta do is get a cat. It\'s not really that hard. But if you go in, you\'ll lay your Jack Webb on her. Flash your brain ray all in her face. She\'ll wind up with leukemia. She\'s a doctor. She don\'t need you flashing away half her med school classes. Five minutes.  KAY Two minutes!  JAY OK.  And he continues into the morgue, leaving Kay waiting outside.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  LAUREL SLAMS into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by EDGAR. He leans in, close, furious, the driver\'s pistol in one hand.  EDGAR Where is the animal?!  LAUREL I told you, I don\'t know!  Orion is running behind their backs.  EDGAR Let\'s see if we can find it.  He grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue. Then  the BELL and a VOICE from the corridor outside.  JAY (O.S.) Hello? Anybody here?  Edgar stops.  The bell DINGS again.  JAY (O.S.) Hello?   INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  In the corridor, JAY looks around. No Tony, no answer to the bell.  He DINGS once more, then heads into the back.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  JAY comes into the morgue. LAUREL is in there, standing right up next to an examination table, but there is no corpse on the table, just a sheet draped over it. She just stands there, in the middle of the room, staring at Jay.  JAY Uh, hi.  LAUREL (oddly) Hello.  JAY (flashes a badge) I\'m Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth precinct. A cat came in here with a corpse the other day. ""Orion"" on the name tag.  LAUREL Yes. That\'s right.  JAY Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat\'s a witness in a murder case and I\'m going to need to take it with me.  LAUREL I don\'t know where the cat is.  JAY You don\'t?  LAUREL No. (lowers her voice to a whisper) Maybe you could take me with you instead.  Jay looks at her.  JAY Damn, you do start fast, don\'t you?  LAUREL I\'d really like to go with you. Now.  Jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this woman. Edgar is seen below the table, trying to see through the sheet, grabbing Laurel\'s ankle with one hand and clenching the gun with the other.  JAY And, uh, why exactly is that?  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  KAY comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor.  He checks his watch, then leans against the counter and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. Waiting.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  Laurel seems to be going crazy. She seems irritated with him, but it doesn\'t go with what she\'s saying.  LAUREL I have something I need to show you.  She looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist. Edgar does a heads up as if thinking ""Huh?"".  JAY Now slow down, you don\'t have to hit the gas like that.  She leans in and lowers her voice.  LAUREL You don\'t understand. You really need to see this.  JAY I will, I will. One thing, I got to drive. It\'s not some macho trip. I\'m saying that\'s the way I get down.  Edgar is rolling his eyes down the table.  LAUREL Look...  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a SIZZLE, hit from a gob of goo.  Kay furrows his brow. Odd. He looks up, sharply.  Above him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He\'s dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  Laurel is at the end of her rope.  LAUREL Look, stud, I don\'t know how many more times I\'m going to get to tell you this. There\'s something --  She points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her.  LAUREL (CONT\'D) -- that you have to help me with.  Jay\'s smile vanishes as if he understands. Laurel nods positively, Edgar scoffs below. Jay reaches for the gun on his jacket.  ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on top of the examination table. Edgar snaps an arm up and grabs the cat, turning the table. Laurel screams.  Kay enters the morgue holding a pistol, gets right next to Jay already pointing the Noisy Cricket at Edgar, who holds the pistol under Laurel\'s chin, using her body to shield his own.  KAY Freeze it, Bug!  Edgar is walking backwards holding Laurel.  LAUREL (to Jay) CHRIST, are you THICK!  JAY How was I supposed to know!?!  LAUREL What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!  JAY If you weren\'t coming on like--  LAUREL Oh, that\'s SO typical. Any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence, men just --  EDGAR Everybody shut UP!  KAY Let her go, Shit Eater.  EDGAR Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that kind of talk in my end of the universe, but compared to you humans, I\'m the top rung on the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all right?!  KAY You\'re breakin\' my heart. Show me your face and I\'ll cure all your ills.  EDGAR Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?  Edgar grabs Laurel\'s neck.  EDGAR (CONT\'D) Would you care to see the fly get even?  KAY How far can you go with no ship? If that\'s what you call that space trash we got locked in the office.  EDGAR Put the weapons down!  KAY Never gonna happen, Insect.  The Galaxy is seen hanging from Edgar\'s gun hand. Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance, slowly, cornering him.  JAY It\'s okay, Laurel!  LAUREL HOW is it okay?!  JAY I mean it\'s going to be okay!  EDGAR Don\'t bet on it, meat sack.  And with that he turns, leaps --  -- and CRASHES right through the window, into the air shaft.  EXT. MORGUE (SIDE STREET) - DUSK  EDGAR, still clutching LAUREL, EXPLODES up over a railing.  Nobody looks twice as Edgar, dragging Laurel (with his arm over her mouth), races toward the nearby  Manhattan Street.  INT. MORGUE - AIR SHAFT - DUSK  Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and the walls are smooth anyway.  They turn and run back.  EXT. OUTSIDE MORGUE - DUSK  EDGAR, with LAUREL, RUNS right in front of a CAB, which screeches to a halt inches from them.  INT. MORGUE - DUSK Jay and Kay  rush out of the morgue.  INT.  CAB - EXT. OUTSIDE MORGUE - DUSK Edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the Cabbie out the door. He then pulls the wooden seat-beads, throws them atop the Cabbie, and pushes Laurel in before him, leaving her behind the wheel. He then tosses a crown that wason the car panel on the cabbie before taking the seat and closing the door.  Edgar shows Laurel the POSTCARDS  he took from the display on the newsstand.  EDGAR Take me here.  LAUREL What???  Edgar reveals two bug mandibles inside his mouth and SLAMS HIS FOOT on the gas pedal.  Laurel\'s head snaps back as the car rocks forward.  The furious Cab Driver runs off after it, still yelling as he disappears around the corner.  CUT TO: INT. CAB - AFTERNOON  Edgar opens his mouth and swallows the icon, as Laurel stares in disbelief. He smiles.  CUT TO: NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK The car screeches out into traffic, swerving wildly as Laurel is forced to make a 90-degree turn. The car fishtails wildly, swiping an oncoming car as it straightens and heads into the traffic.  CUT TO: OUTSIDE MORGUE A second later, KAY and JAY rush out into the street. The cab is nowhere to be seen. Jay runs into the street, noticing the wooden beads and crown.  JAY He\'s in a cab!  And Jay jumps down the rain and runs towards the street. Kay doesn\'t even change his expression as he walks the other way.  CUT TO: NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK Jay is running down the street, where DOZENS of cabs are waiting at the intersection.  He\'s running from cab to cab, and points his gun to one where there is a passenger in the front.  JAY Don\'t move! Don\'t move! Don\'t move!  -- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found.  PASSENGER Hey, man, what?  Up ahead the light turns green and the tide of taxis wash away, leaving Jay on the street. Kay stops the LTD right next to Jay.  KAY He\'s not leaving the planet in a cab. Let\'s go.  Jay enters through the back door. Kay drives away.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT  Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World\'s Fair mural, and head toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in frenetic activity in response to the threat from above.  KAY (to tech at a desk) Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan; if it\'s not human, it\'s not leaving the island.  KAY (CONT\'D) What\'ve we got from our friends upstairs?  ZED Same thing: ""Deliver the galaxy.""  KAY Yeah, well the bug\'s got the galaxy, but we\'ve got his ship. He\'s got to be looking for a way out.  Just then, a loud ALARM wails.  COMPUTER VOICE Warning. Protonic fusion detection.  AT THE MAIN VIEWING SCREEN, A GREEN LINE shoots out from the Arquillian ship, striking the North Pole.  Every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going off.  JAY WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?!  ZED Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we have a galactic standard week to respond.  JAY A galactic standard week? How the hell long is that?  KAY One hour.  JAY One hour? Then what?  Kay seems to be holding laughter. Viewing the screen, it now reads: MIB DELIVER THE GALAXY OR THE EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED... SORRY  JAY (O.S.) That\'s bullshit.  The message now has a countdown that starts rolling from 1:00:00:00 in ""Earth Time Remaining""  KAY (O.S.) Kid, to keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy.  ZED (O.S.) And whatever planet it\'s on.  JAY You\'re talking about US!  ZED Sucks, doesn\'t it?  As Kay and Zed look through a map, Jay walks, deep in thought. Over him we hear:  KAY I\'m getting the location of every interstellar vehicle within 100 miles.  ZED I already did. Frank took the last ship on the planet.  KAY Snedens Landing and Throg\'s Neck.  ZED They\'re gone.  KAY Atlantic City?  ZED Adios.  KAY Bayonne?  ZED Gone.  KAY There\'s Three Mile Island.  ZED Gone.  JAY Y\'all.  KAY Staten Island?  ZED Gone, thank God.  JAY Fellas!  KAY We\'re running out of time. If the bug leaves with the galaxy--  JAY Hey. Old guys!  Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling.  JAY (CONT\'D) Do those still work?  They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World\'s Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by --  -- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we --  DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR - NIGHT  -- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away. EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver\'s door and follows behind her, still holding his weapon on her.  EDGAR You\'re coming with me.  LAUREL What?! Why?!  EDGAR It\'s a long trip. I\'ll need a snack.  And he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships.  It\'s shown a postcard on the passenger\'s seat featuring the World\'s Fair towers.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  Kay turns sharply to the right, SMACKING Jay around. Looking up ahead, he sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel.  JAY Wait, the tunnel?!  KAY You know a better way to Queens?  JAY It\'s gonna be packed.  EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT  The LTD races through the tunnel at top speed. It\'s clear driving for a few seconds, but then they round a bend --  -- and there\'s a traffic jam up ahead.  INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  Kay approaches the line of cars at top speed, with no intention of slowing down. Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.  KAY Remember the little button?  JAY Yeah?!  KAY Push the red button.  Jay JAMS his finger down on the red flashing button.  KAY (CONT\'D) You may want to wear a seat belt.  EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MIB LTD - NIGHT  As the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve, its shape actually changing. The sides and back extend as some sort of endoskeleton pushes the ""normal"" panels out. It becomes a larger, wirier machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and metallic tendons.  JAY Kay! Kay!  Kay\'s car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last possible moment it swerves off to the side, a SUCKING SOUND coming from underneath it. Jay is heard screaming as...  Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic below.  It keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels clinging to the roof of the tunnel.  INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  Jay falls from his seat with a CLUNK, onto the upside down ceiling of the car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they tear through the tunnel, ZOOMING over the bottlenecked traffic underneath.  KAY You\'re much too tense. You\'re a young man. You need to relax. Learn to take some joy in your work.  Close on the car\'s 8-track player.  KAY (O.S.) You like music?  Kay puts on a tape labeled ""Elvis - Promised Land"", which instantly starts playing.  JAY Man!  KAY That\'s better.  Kay mouths along with the song, as Jay struggles to position himself on the ceiling.  EXT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  From outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel. A ceiling panel is approaching...  JAY Kay! Kay!  Kay swerves the vehicle to dodge the arrow.   INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  JAY You do know Elvis is dead?  KAY No, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.  And they disappear out the other end of the tunnel --  INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  -- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat.  He cranks the wheel to the left.  EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT  Approaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window --  -- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear.  CUT TO:  EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT  EDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships, pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top.  LAUREL You don\'t want to eat me. I\'m a very important person on my planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even. There are those who worship me, yes. I\'m not trying to impress you with this, I\'m just letting you know. It could start a war.  EDGAR Good. War means food for my family, all seventy-eight million of them. That\'s a lot of mouths to feed, your highness.  LAUREL You\'re a wonderful father, but I\'m staying here!  And with that she elbows him in the back of the head. Edgar reels, and tosses her in a nearby tree.  Laurel lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the ground.  Above, Edgar gestures as if ""goodbye"" and just keeps climbing. He eventually enters the flying saucer from a hatch below.  EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR - NIGHT  The LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds.  AT THE TRUNK, KAY grab the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet. Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. He hands it to Jay.  JAY Now, that\'s what I\'m talking about.  Kay gets a similar gun.  KAY Roaches check in.  He cocks the gun. Jay does the same.  JAY But they don\'t check out.  Kay walks away, to get a clear view, Jay follows.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT  The MIB staffers are in frenetic activity as the claxons still ring.  COMPUTER Warning: Eight minutes to the destruction of Earth.  Zed watches the monitor reading exactly that. He finally starts to look worried.  EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR - NIGHT  As if on cue, the saucer Edgar enter closes and begins to HUM. Lights ignite, and the ship begins to rise.  EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT  Laurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement.  EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT  At Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side, the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible.  But at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the ball is headed.  All eyes in the house are on the Mets\' CENTER FIELDER, except for his eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen, his jaw drops --  -- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall behind him. The crowd BOOS viciouly.  EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR - NIGHT  Kay fiddles with the weapon he took from the trunk.  KAY We\'ll use pulsar level five, sub-sonic implosion factor --  JAY What?  Kay cocks the gun, points it at the sky.  KAY Just shoot the damn thing on the count of three.  Jay raises his weapon too.  KAY (CONT\'D) One...two... three!  They pull their triggers. Jay takes a step back from the recoil As two enormous shock waves roll out from the barrel of the guns.  EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT  The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship, then it HITS the ship --  -- which explodes. Hurtling back toward them.  EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR - NIGHT  The saucer BREAKS through the flags near the Unisphere and then CRASHES through the enormous steel globe, and THUDS to the earth, CRASHING through brush, dirt and rock...  stopping just a few steps away from Jay and Kay, who just stood there watching the crash-land.  A hatch comes up...revealing Edgar, more decomposed than ever walking slowly toward them, with contained fury.  EDGAR You idiots! You don\'t get it. I\'ve won. It\'s over.You milk-suckers! You don\'t matter! In a few seconds you won\'t even be matter!  KAY You are under arrest for violating number 4-1-53 of the Tycho accord.  KAY So hand over any galaxy you might be carrying and step away from your busted-ass vehicle and put your hands on your head.  Edgar points up and smiles as he walks down the landing ramp.  EDGAR I\'ll put my hands on my head!  Edgar does that.  EDGAR Like this?  Then flexes his arms, still encased in flesh. His giant pincers RIP free of the rotting skin.  He extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be twelve feet across.  Now the skin and clothes on Edgar\'s legs begins to CRACK and SHRED. They BURST APART, revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs. The bug raises himself aloft on his legs.  He sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes the way of the arms and legs. The torso EXPLODES in great rendering of cloth and skin, and finally  Edgar\'s head simply BURSTS apart, SPATTERING against the walls. Edgar now reveals himself as he really is: a giant cockroach, a scaly tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each.  Kay and Jay pump their guns and aim at the Bug.  Suddenly the Bug SPITS. And a HUGE, SLIMY WAD OF GOO shoots from him and engulfs both shotguns. The Bug snorts it back, tearing them from Jay and Kay\'s grasp, then swallowing them.  Jay and Kay have only a second to react before --  The Bug SWIPES at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone brushing aside a gnat -- and SENDS THEM FLYING FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR.  Jay and Kay hit the ground with loud grunts.  JAY That did not go at all like I had planned.  KAY Whatever happens, don\'t let him on the second ship.  JAY What are you talking about?  KAY Keep him on this planet.  JAY Kay, where are you going?  KAY Getting my gun back.  JAY What!?  Kay gets to his feet and starts walking after the Bug. Kay steps in front of the departing Bug and yells.  KAY (CONT\'D) Hey, Bug! You know how many of your kind I\'ve swatted with a newspaper?  The Bug stops. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off against the giant alien. The Bug\'s dripping fangs inches from Kay\'s face.  KAY You\'re just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me! Eat me!  The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS, lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth. JAY looks on, in stunned horror...  JAY Kay! Kay!  The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. His mandibles push Kay down the Bug\'s throat.  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT  Laurel is watching in horror on the tree.  EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR - ON JAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT THE BUG  STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH.  INT. BUG - NIGHT  Kay, swimming in the Bug\'s intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging.  EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR - NIGHT  Jay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug.  The concrete HITS the Bug\'s head -- it falls and gives an angry yelp.  JAY What\'s up?  Jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug.  JAY You just going to eat and run, huh? What about dessert?  The Bug kicks Jay with his second pair of limbs.  The hurled Jay falls near a burning tree branch. Dizzy, he starts to get up.  JAY That\'s it? Where you going?This party\'s just getting started.  He grabs the burning branch.  JAY Where\'re you going? Where you going?  Jay waves the flames in front of the bug, who dodges the branch.  JAY Listen. There\'s one way off this planet, baby, and that\'s through me.  The Bug punches Jay in the face. He falls on the ground, and narrowly misses being stepped on.  Jay rolls right underneath the Bug\'s legs. His hand falls on something in the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug\'s apparently vulnerable underbelly, right above him.  He grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up, into the Bug\'s gut, when;  The Bug bends its head down between its legs.  Jay falls to the ground again.  The Bug starts climbing the tower. Jay howls in frustration.  In frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, grabbing its tail, trying to drag it down. The Bug notes, and looks down. He shakes the tail until Jay is hurled away, sending him SAILING twenty feet through the air.  Jay CRASHES into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage.  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT  Laurel\'s branch breaks, she falls a small bit to the ground, near the burning branch. She promptly gets up.  EXT. WORLD\'S FAIR -  NIGHT  The Bug continues to climb the tower, and in the distance, a battered Jay gets up. Despite struggling to talk, he continues to taunt the Bug. Laurel is watching him from behind a bush.  JAY Where\'re you going? Why you runnin\', huh? I\'m still standing. Come on.  Jay extends his arm at the creature.  JAY Bring it. Bring it.  He notices something on his arm...two cockroaches in his sleeve.  Jay has one last desperate idea...He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces.  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROACHES pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling like a black glittering river, away from the garbage...  CLOSE ON JAY\'S FOOT as he steps on the roach.  CRUNCH.  ON THE BUG as he flinches on the ladder -- he hates that sound.  ON JAY. He smiles.  JAY I\'m sorry. Was that your auntie?  ON THE BUG. He turns around, anger burning in his eyes.  Jay knows he\'s getting to him. He moves his foot over another roach.  JAY (CONT\'D) That must mean that\'s your uncle, huh?  CRUNCH! He crushes another one.  JAY (CONT\'D) You know you all look alike.  The Bug falls down from the steps and starts to walk towards Jay.  JAY Well, well. Big bad bug got a bit of a soft spot, huh?  Jay keeps crunching roaches while the Bug gets near him . Laurel is still watching.  JAY What I can\'t understand is why you...  got to come down here bringing all this ruckus. Snatching up galaxies and everything. My attitude is, don\'t start nothing, won\'t be nothing.  The Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.  JAY You need to ease up out my face before something bad happen to you.  The triggering noise of the Deatomizer is heard.  JAY Too late.  Kay BLASTS a hole right in the middle of the Bug\'s midsection. The front of the Bug\'s thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay.  The Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end falls nearby; the head flying behind Jay.  Kay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping the atomizer from his slippery fingers.  The other gun sails off into the darkness. Both spit the bug juice that fall on their mouths.  The Galaxy drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay\'s feet, and CLATTERS to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor.  Jay calmly bends down and picks it up, as Kay pulls out his pocket phone and hits a number.  KAY Zed. Call the Arquillians. Tell \'em we have the galaxy.  ZED (O.S) You got it, friend.  Kay flips the phone closed.  JAY Going to get your gun back, huh?  KAY I like this gun.  As the two talk, THE FRONT HALF OF THE BUG is crawling in the background.  JAY While you were in there playing around, I was here doing all the work. First, I had to bean him in the head with this big rock.              Then I was going to hit him with a two-by-four. He kicked me. You know, it hurt. Then I got the fire. I was \'\'yah\'\' with the fire.  KAY Not bad for your second day of work, is it?  JAY This definitely rates about a  9.0 on my weird-shit-o-meter.  KAY Should\'ve been here for the Zeronion migration in  1968. I guess you weren\'t even alive in \'68.  HISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. And just before the jaws snap down on their heads...  BOOM! The Bug\'s head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further.  They turn to see...  LAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the barrel smoking.  LAUREL Interesting job you guys got.  Jay spits the new bug goo that covered him.  CUT TO:  EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT  We see JAY and KAY walking towards the MIB HQ.  JAY Look, I know we got rules and everything, but... she did help us bust that bug. Maybe we don\'t have to flashy thing her.  Kay pulls out the neuralyzer.  JAY Come on. Who she gonna tell? She hang out with all dead people.  KAY It\'s not for her.It\'s for me.  JAY What?  KAY (looking up at the sky) They\'re beautiful, aren\'t they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they\'re beautiful.  JAY Kay, you\'re scaring your partner.  KAY I haven\'t been training a partner -- I\'ve been training a replacement.  JAY Wait a minute, Kay. I can\'t do this job by myself.  LAUREL (O.S.) Hey, guys.  Cut to Kay\'s LTD is parked nearby, LAUREL leaning her back against the car.  LAUREL My apartment isn\'t anywhere near here. It\'s not on the same island.  Kay starts dialing back the neuralyzer, shows the dials to Jay.  KAY Days. Months. Years. Always face it forwards.  He hands the neuralyzer to Jay. Taps his pocket. Indicates for him to put his glasses on. Jay resists.  KAY I\'ve just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach. That\'s one of a hundred memories I don\'t want.  Jay takes the neuralyzer. Slips on his glasses.  KAY See you around, sport.  Jay raises the neuralyzer. With a brilliant FLASH, the screen turns white.  JAY No, you won\'t.  CUT TO:  EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY  CLOSE ON various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them. DETROIT HAS CAR THAT DEFIES GRAVITY! Secret Tests in N.Y.\'s Tunnel Mets\' Centerfielder Says: ""UFO MADE ME MISS HOME RUN BALL!"" MAN AWAKENS FROM 30-YEAR COMA Returns to Girl He Left Behind  The last one has A large photograph shows a smiling KAY, arm-in-arm with ELIZABETH RESTON, his long-lost fiancee, in her back yard in Tempe, Arizona.  She holds a large bouquet of flowers, the same kind he brought but never gave her thirty years ago.  JAY, who\'s reading the paper, smiles.  AT THE CURB, Jay hurries back to the LTD with the newspapers. ELLE, (formerly Laurel), is waiting, leaning against the hood. Tailored black suit. Black shoes. Short-cropped hair. The look never looked better.  ELLE Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9 emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks -- Bulls game.  It\'s apparent Jay has a new ""hip"" getup - oval-rim sunglasses, long Nehru jacket, and band collar without a necktie.  JAY Put in a call for Dennis Rodman, e\'s from that planet.  ELLE Rodman? You\'re kidding.  JAY Nope.  ELLE Not much of a disguise.  Both car doors SLAM, Jay drops it in gear, and the LTD BLASTS away from the curb.  EXT. NEW YORK CITY BLOCK - DAY  The LTD is just one of many cars in a jam-packed Manhattan city block.  FROM UP IN THE CLOUDS  Manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl.  FROM THE STRATOSPHERE  The east coast of the United States is just part of a much larger land mass.  FROM THE EOSPHERE  North America is just a small portion of the planet Earth.  FROM SPACE  Earth is just a tiny ball in our solar system.  FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MILKY WAY  Our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field.  FROM OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY  The Milky Way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy spirals.  FROM THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE  There seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists seems to be contained in one tiny ball --  -- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red dirt.  An ALIEN HAND reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering and bouncing across the dirt, where it HITS another ball. The hand grabs both balls, and puts the marbles in a pouch, where they CLICK a dozen other big blue balls just like it.

Steady, sullivans! Mannequins pause! Longtong’s breach is fallen down but Graunya’s spreed’s abroad. Ahdostay, feedailyones, and feel the Flucher’s bawls for the total of your flouts is not fit to fan his fettle, O! Have a ring and sing wohl! Chin, chin! Chin, chin! And of course all chimed din width the eatmost boviality. Swiping rums and beaunes and sherries and ciders and negus and cit — ronnades too. The strongers. Oho, oho, Mester Begge, you’re about to be bagged in the bog again. Bugge. But softsies seuf-sighed: Eheu, for gassies! But, lo! lo! by the threnning gods, human, erring and condonable, what the statues of our kuo, who is the messchef be our kuang, ashu ashure there, the unforgettable treeshade looms up behind the jostling judgements of those, as all should owe, malrecapturable days.  Tap and pat and tapatagain, (fire firstshot, Missiers the Refusel-eers! Peingpeong! For saxonlootie!) three tommix, soldiers free, cockaleak and cappapee, of the Coldstream. Guards were walking, in (pardonnez-leur, je vous en prie, eh?) Montgomery Street. One voiced an opinion in which on either wide (pardonnez!), nod-ding, all the Finner Camps concurred (je vous en prie, eh?). It was the first woman, they said, souped him, that fatal wellesday, Lili Coninghams, by suggesting him they go in a field. Wroth mod eldfar, ruth redd stilstand, wrath wrackt wroth, confessed private Pat Marchison retro. (Terse!) Thus contenters with san-toys play. One of our coming Vauxhall ontheboards who is resting for the moment (she has been callit by a noted stagey ele-cutioner a wastepacket Sittons) was interfeud in a waistend pewty parlour. Looking perhaps even more pewtyflushed in her cherry- derry padouasoys, girdle and braces by the halfmoon and Seven Stars, russets from the Blackamoor’s Head, amongst the climbing boys at his Eagle and Child and over the corn and hay emptors at their Black and All Black, Mrs F . . . A . . . saidaside, half in stage of whisper to her confidante glass, while recoopering her cartwheel chapot (ahat! — and we now know what thimbles a baquets on lallance a talls mean), she hoped Sid Arthar would git a Chrissman’s portrout of orange and lemonsized orchids with hollegs and ether, from the feeatre of the Innocident, as the worryld had been uncained. Then, while it is odrous comparisoning to the sprangflowers of his burstday which was a virid — able goddinpotty for the reinworms and the charlattinas and all branches of climatitis, it has been such a wanderful noyth untirely, added she, with many regards to Maha’s pranjapansies. (Tart!) Prehistoric, obitered to his dictaphone an entychologist: his pro-penomen is a properismenon. A dustman nocknamed Seven — churches in the employ of Messrs Achburn, Soulpetre and Ashreborn, prairmakers, Glintalook, was asked by the sisterhood the vexed question during his midday collation of leaver and buckrom alternatively with stenk and kitteney phie in a hash-housh and, thankeaven, responsed impulsively: We have just been propogandering his nullity suit and what they took out of his ear among my own crush. All our fellows at O’Dea’s sages with Aratar Calaman he is a cemented brick, buck it all! A more nor usually sober cardriver, who was jauntingly hosing his runabout, Ginger Jane, took a strong view. Lorry hosed her as he talked and this is what he told rewritemen: Irewaker is just a plain pink joint reformee in private life but folks all have it by brehemons laws he has parliamentary honours. Eiskaffier said (Louigi’s, you know that man’s, brillant Savourain): Mon foie, you wish to ave some homelette, yes, lady! Good, mein leber! Your hegg he must break himself See, I crack, so, he sit in the poele, umbedimbt! A perspirer (over sixty) who was keeping up his tennises panted he kne ho har twa to clect infamatios but a diffpair flannels climb wall and trespassing on doorbell. After fullblown Braddon hear this fresky troterella! A railways barmaid’s view (they call her Spilltears Rue) was thus expressed: to sympathisers of the Dole Line, Death Avenue, anent those objects of her pity-prompted ministrance, to wet, man and his syphon. Ehim! It is ever too late to whissle when Phyllis floods her stable. It would be skar-lot shame to jailahim in lockup, as was proposed to him by the Seddoms creature what matter what merrytricks went off with his revulverher in connections with ehim being a norphan and enjoining such wicked illth, ehim! Well done, Drumcollakill! Kitty Tyrrel is proud of you, was the reply of a B.O.T. official (O blame gnot the board!) while the Daughters Benkletter mur-mured in uniswoon: Golforgilhisjurylegs! Brian Lynsky, the cub curser, was questioned at his shouting box, Bawlonabraggat, and gave a snappy comeback, when saying: Paw! Once more I’ll hellbowl! I am for caveman chase and sahara sex, burk you! Them two bitches ought to be leashed, canem! Up hog and hoar hunt! Paw! A wouldbe martyr, who is attending on sanit Asitas where he is being taught to wear bracelets, when grilled on the point, revealed the undoubted fact that the consequence would be that so long as Sankya Moondy played his mango tricks under the mysttetry, with shady apsaras sheltering in his leaves’ licence and his shadowers torrifried by the potent bolts of indradiction, there would be fights all over Cuxhaven. (Tosh!) Missioner Ida Womb-well, the seventeenyearold revivalist, said concerning the coinci — dent of interfizzing with grenadines and other respectable and disgusted peersons using the park: That perpendicular person is a brut! But a magnificent brut! ‘Caligula’ (Mr Danl Magrath, bookmaker, wellknown to Eastrailian poorusers of the Sydney Parade Ballotin) was, as usual, antipodal with his: striving todie, hopening tomellow, Ware Splash. Cobbler. We have meat two hourly, sang out El Caplan Buycout, with the famous padre’s turridur’s capecast, meet too ourly, matadear! Dan Meiklejohn, precentor, of S.S. Smack and Olley’s was probiverbal with his upsiduxit: mutatus mutandus. Dauran’s lord (‘Sniffpox’) and Moir-gan’s lady (‘Flatterfun’) took sides and crossed and bowed to each other’s views and recrossed themselves. The dirty dubs upin their flies, went too free, echoed the dainly drabs downin their scenities, una mona. Sylvia Silence, the girl detective (Meminerva, but by now one hears turtlings all over Doveland!) when supplied with informations as to the several facets of the case in her cozy-dozy bachelure’s flat, quite overlooking John a’Dream’s mews, leaned back in her really truly easy chair to query restfully through her vowelthreaded syllabelles: Have you evew thought, wepow-tew, that sheew gweatness was his twadgedy? Nevewtheless ac — cowding to my considewed attitudes fow this act he should pay the full penalty, pending puwsuance, as pew Subsec. 32, section II, of the C. L.

Jarley Jilke began to silke for he couldn’t get home to Jelsey but ended with: He’s got the sack that helped him moult instench of his gladsome rags. Meagher, a naval rating, seated on one of the granite cromlech setts of our new fish-shambles for the usual aireating after the ever popular act, with whom were Questa and Puella, piquante and quoite, (this had a cold in her brain while that felt a sink in her summock, wit’s wat, wot’s wet) was encouraged, although nearvanashed himself, by one of his co-affianced to get your breath, Walt, and gobbit and when ther chidden by her fastra sastra to saddle up your pance, Naville, thus cor replied to her other’s thankskissing: I lay my two fingerbuttons, fiancee Meagher, (he speaks!) he was to blame about your two velvetthighs up Horniman’s Hill — as hook and eye blame him or any other piscman? — but I also think, Puellywally, by the siege of his trousers there was some-one else behind it — you bet your boughtem blarneys — about their three drummers down Keysars Lane. (Trite!). Be these meer marchant taylor’s fablings of a race referend with oddman rex? Is now all seenheard then forgotten? Can it was, one is fain in this leaden age of letters now to wit, that so diversified outrages (they have still to come!) were planned and partly carried out against so staunch a covenanter if it be true than any of those recorded ever took place for many, we trow, beyessed to and denayed of, are given to us by some who use the truth but sparingly and we, on this side ought to sorrow for their pricking pens on that account. The seventh city, Urovivla, his citadear of refuge, whither (would we believe the laimen and their counts), beyond the outraved gales of Atreeatic, changing clues with a baggermalster, the hejirite had fled, silentioussue-meant under night’s altosonority, shipalone, a raven of the wave, (be mercy, Mara! A he whence Rahoulas!) from the ostmen’s dirtby on the old vic, to forget in expiating manslaughter and, reberthing in remarriment out of dead seekness to devine previ-dence, (if you are looking for the bilder deep your ear on the movietone!) to league his lot, palm and patte, with a papishee. For mine qvinne I thee giftake and bind my hosenband I thee halter. The wastobe land, a lottuse land, a luctuous land, Emerald-illuim, the peasant pastured, in which by the fourth commandment with promise his days apostolic were to be long by the abundant mercy of Him Which Thundereth From On High, murmured, would rise against him with all which in them were, franchisab-les and inhabitands, astea as agora, helotsphilots, do him hurt, poor jink, ghostly following bodily, as were he made a curse for them, the corruptible lay quick, all saints of incorruption-of-an holy nation, the common or ere-ingarden castaway, in red re-surrection to condemn so they might convince him, first pha — roah, Humpheres Cheops Exarchas, of their proper sins. Busi — ness bred to speak with a stiff upper lip to all men and most occa — sions the Man we wot of took little short of fighting chances but for all that he or his or his care were subjected to the horrors of the premier terror of Errorland. (perorhaps!)  We seem to us (the real Us!) to be reading our Amenti in the sixth sealed chapter of the going forth by black. It was after the show at Wednesbury that one tall man, humping a suspicious parcel, when returning late amid a dense particular on his home way from the second house of the Boore and Burgess Christy Menestrels by the old spot, Roy’s Corner, had a barkiss revolver placed to his faced with the words: you’re shot, major: by an unknowable assailant (masked) against whom he had been jealous over, Lotta Crabtree or Pomona Evlyn. More than that Whenn the Waylayer (not a Lucalizod diocesan or even of the Glenda-lough see, but hailing fro’ the prow of Little Britain), mention — ing in a bytheway that he, the crawsopper, had, in edition to Reade’s cutless centiblade, a loaded Hobson’s which left only twin alternatives as, viceversa, either he would surely shoot her, the aunt, by pistol, (she could be okaysure of that!) or, failing of such, bash in Patch’s blank face beyond recognition, pointedly asked with gaeilish gall wodkar blizzard’s business Thornton had with that Kane’s fender only to be answered by the aggravated assaulted that that that was the snaps for him, Midweeks, to sultry well go and find out if he was showery well able. But how trans-paringly nontrue, gentlewriter! His feet one is not a tall man, not at all, man. No such parson. No such fender. No such lumber. No such race. Was it supposedly in connection with a girls, Myramy Huey or Colores Archer, under Flaggy Bridge (for ann there is but one liv and hir newbridge is her old) or to explode his twelvechamber and force a shrievalty entrance that the heavybuilt Abelbody in a butcherblue blouse from One Life One Suit (a men’s wear store), with a most decisive bottle of single in his possession, seized after dark by the town guard at Haveyou-caught-emerod’s temperance gateway was there in a gate’s way.  Fifthly, how parasoliloquisingly truetoned on his first time of hearing the wretch’s statement that, muttering Irish, he had had had o’gloriously a’lot too much hanguest or hoshoe fine to drink in the House of Blazes, the Parrot in Hell, the Orange Tree, the Glibt, the Sun, the Holy Lamb and, lapse not leashed, in Ramitdown’s ship hotel since the morning moment he could dixtinguish a white thread from a black till the engine of the laws declosed unto Murray and was only falling fillthefluthered up against the gatestone pier which, with the cow’s bonnet a’top o’it, he falsetook for a cattlepillar with purest peaceablest intentions. Yet how lamely hobbles the hoy of his then pseudo-jocax axplanation how, according to his own story, he vas a process server and was merely trying to open zozimus a bottlop stoub by mortially hammering his magnum bonum (the curter the club the sorer the savage) against the bludgey gate for the boots about the swan, Maurice Behan, who hastily into his shoes with nothing his hald barra tinnteack and came down with homp, shtemp and jumphet to the tiltyard from the wastes a’sleep in his obi ohny overclothes or choker, attracted by the norse of guns playing Delandy is cartager on the raglar rock to Dulyn, said war’ prised safe in bed as he dreamed that he’d wealthes in mor-mon halls when wokenp by a fourth loud snore out of his land of byelo while hickstrey’s maws was grazing in the moonlight by hearing hammering on the pandywhank scale emanating from the blind pig and anything like it (oonagh!oonagh!) in the whole history of the Mullingcan Inn he never. This battering babel allower the door and sideposts, he always said, was not in the very remotest like the belzey babble of a bottle of boose which would not rouse him out o’ slumber deep but reminded him loads more of the martiallawsey marses of foreign musi-kants’ instrumongs or the overthrewer to the third last days of Pompery, if anything. And that after this most nooningless knockturn the young reine came down desperate and the old liffopotamus started ploring all over the plains, as mud as she cud be, ruinating all the bouchers’ schurts and the backers’ wischandtugs so that be the chandeleure of the Rejaneyjailey they were all night wasching the walters of, the weltering walters off. Whyte.  Just one moment. A pinch in time of the ideal, musketeers!

He vows her to be his own honeylamb, swears they will be papa pals, by Sam, and share good times way down west in a guaranteed happy lovenest when May moon she shines and they twit twinkle all the night, combing the comet’s tail up right and shooting popguns at the stars. Creampuffs all to dime! Every nice, missymackenzies! For dear old grumpapar, he’s gone on the razzledar, through gazing and crazing and blazing at the stars. Compree! She wants her wardrobe to hear from above by return with cash so as she can buy her Peter Robinson trousseau and cut a dash with Arty, Bert or possibly Charley Chance (who knows?) so tolloll Mr Hunker you’re too dada for me to dance (so off she goes!) and that’s how half the gels in town has got their bottom drars while grumpapar he’s trying to hitch his braces on to his trars. But old grum he’s not so clean dippy between sweet you and yum (not on your life, boy! not in those trousers! not by a large jugful!) for someplace on the sly, where Furphy he isn’t by, old grum has his gel number two (bravevow, our Grum!) and he would like to canoodle her too some part of the time for he is downright fond of his number one but O he’s fair mashed on peaches number two so that if he could only canoodle the two, chivee chivoo, all three would feel genuinely happy, it’s as simple as A.

With which clap, trap and soddenment, three to a loaf, our mutual friends the fender and the bottle at the gate seem to be implicitly in the same bateau, so to singen, bearing also several of the earmarks of design, for there is in fact no use in putting a tooth in a snipery of that sort and the amount of all those sort of things which has been going on onceaday in and twiceaday out every other nachtistag among all kinds of pro-miscious individuals at all ages in private homes and reeboos publikiss and allover all and elsewhere throughout secular sequence the country over and overabroad has been particularly stupendous. To be continued. Federals’ Uniteds’ Transports’ Unions’ for Exultations’ of Triumphants’ Ecstasies.  But resuming inquiries. Will it ever be next morning the postal unionist’s (officially called carrier’s, Letters Scotch, Limited) strange fate (Fierceendgiddyex he’s hight, d.e., the losel that hucks around missivemaids’ gummibacks) to hand in a huge chain envelope, written in seven divers stages of ink, from blanch-essance to lavandaiette, every pothook and pancrook bespaking the wisherwife, superscribed and subpencilled by yours A Laugh-able Party, with afterwite, S.A.G., to Hyde and Cheek, Eden — berry, Dubblenn, WC? Will whatever will be written in lappish language with inbursts of Maggyer always seem semposed, black looking white and white guarding black, in that siamixed twoa-talk used twist stern swift and jolly roger? Will it bright upon us, nightle, and we plunging to our plight? Well, it might now, mircle, so it light. Always and ever till Cox’s wife, twice Mrs Hahn, pokes her beak into the matter with Owen K. after her, to see whawa smutter after, will this kiribis pouch filled with litterish frag-ments lurk dormant in the paunch of that halpbrother of a herm, a pillarbox?  The coffin, a triumph of the illusionist’s art, at first blench naturally taken for a handharp (it is handwarp to tristinguish jubabe from jabule or either from tubote when all three have just been invened) had been removed from the hardware premises of Oetzmann and Nephew, a noted house of the gonemost west, which in the natural course of all things continues to supply funeral requisites of every needed description. Why needed, though? Indeed needed (wouldn’t you feel like rattanfowl if you hadn’t the oscar!) because the flash brides or bride in their lily boleros one games with at the Nivynubies’ finery ball and your upright grooms that always come right up with you (and by jingo when they do!) what else in this mortal world, now ours, when meet there night, mid their nackt, me there na-ket, made their nought the hour strikes, would bring them right — came back in the flesh, thumbs down, to their orses and their hashes.  To proceed. We might leave that nitrience of oxagiants to take its free of the air and just analectralyse that very chymerical com-bination, the gasbag where the warderworks. And try to pour somour heiterscene up thealmostfere. In the bottled heliose case continuing, Long Lally Tobkids, the special, sporting a fine breast of medals, and a conscientious scripturereader to boot in the brick and tin choorch round the coroner, swore like a Norewheezian tailliur on the stand before the proper functionary that he was up against a right querrshnorrt of a mand in the butcher of the blues who, he guntinued, on last epening after delivering some car-casses mattonchepps and meatjutes on behalf of Messrs Otto Sands and Eastman, Limericked, Victuallers, went and, with his unmitigated astonissment, hickicked at the dun and dorass against all the runes and, when challenged about the pretended hick (it was kickup and down with him) on his solemn by the imputant imputed, said simply: I appop pie oath, Phillyps Captain. You did, as I sostressed before. You are deepknee in error, sir, Madam Tomkins, let me then tell you, replied with a gentlewomanly salaam MackPartland, (the meatman’s family, and the oldest in the world except nick, name.) And Phelps was flayful with his peeler. But his phizz fell.  Now to the obverse. From velveteens to dimities is barely a fivefinger span and hence these camelback excesses are thought to have been instigated by one or either of the causing causes of all, those rushy hollow heroines in their skirtsleeves, be she ma-gretta be she the posque. Oh! Oh! Because it is a horrible thing to have to say to say to day but one dilalah, Lupita Lorette, short-ly after in a fit of the unexpectednesses drank carbolic with all her dear placid life before her and paled off while the other soiled dove that’s her sister-inlove, Luperca Latouche, finding one day while dodging chores that she stripped teasily for binocu-lar man and that her jambs were jimpjoyed to see each other, the nautchy girly soon found her fruitful hat too small for her and rapidly taking time, look, she rapidly took to necking, partying and selling her spare favours in the haymow or in lumber closets or in the greenawn ad huck (there are certain intimacies in all ladies’ lavastories we just lease to imagination) or in the sweet churchyard close itself for a bit of soft coal or an array of thin trunks, serving whom in fine that same hot coney a la Zingara which our own little Graunya of the chilired cheeks dished up to the greatsire of Oscar, that son of a Coole.

Nor needs none shaft ne stele from Phenicia or Little Asia to obelise on the spout, neither pobalclock neither folksstone, nor sunkenness in Tomar’s Wood to bewray how erpressgangs score off the rued.

Tatcho, tawney yeeklings! The column of lumps lends the pattrin of the leaves behind us. If violence to life, limb and chattels, often as not, has been the expression, direct or through an agent male, of womanhid offended, (ah! ah!), has not levy of black mail from the times the fairies were in it, and fain for wilde erthe blothoms followed an impressive private reputation for whispered sins?  Now by memory inspired, turn wheel again to the whole of the wall. Where Gyant Blyant fronts Peannlueamoore There was once upon a wall and a hooghoog wall a was and such a wall-hole did exist.

And let oggs be good old gaggles and Isther Estarr play Yesther Asterr. In the drema of Sorestost Areas, Diseased. A stonehinged gate then was for another thing while the suroptimist had bought and enlarged that shack under fair rental of one yearlyng sheep, (prime) value of sixpence, and one small yearlyng goat (cadet) value of eight-pence, to grow old and happy (hogg it and kidd him) for the re — minants of his years; and when everything was got up for the purpose he put an applegate on the place by no means as some pretext a bedstead in loo thereof to keep out donkeys (the pig-dirt hanging from the jags to this hour makes that clear) and just thenabouts the iron gape, by old custom left open to prevent the cats from getting at the gout, was triplepatlockt on him on purpose by his faithful poorters to keep him inside probably and possibly enaunter he felt like sticking out his chest too far and tempting gracious providence by a stroll on the peoplade’s egg-day, unused as he was yet to being freely clodded.  O, by the by, lets wee brag of praties, it ought to be always remembered in connection with what has gone before that there was a northroomer, Herr Betreffender, out for his zimmer hole-digs, digging in number 32 at the Rum and Puncheon (Branch of Dirty Dick’s free house) in Laxlip (where the Sockeye Sammons were stopping at the time orange fasting) prior to that, a Kom-merzial (Gorbotipacco, he was wreaking like Zentral Oylrubber) from Osterich, the U.S.E. paying (Gaul save the mark!)

Now you must know, franksman, to make a heart of glass, that the game of gaze and bandstand butchery was merely a Patsy O’Strap tissue of threats and obuses such as roebucks raugh at pinnacle’s peak and after this sort. Humphrey’s unsolicited visitor, Davy or Titus, on a burgley’s clan march from the middle west, a hikely excellent crude man about road who knew his Bullfoost Mountains like a starling bierd, after doing a long dance untidled to Cloudy Green, deposend his bockstump on the waityoumay-wantme, after having blew some quaker’s (for you!

\'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing Nothing \'cause for- a brain that is amazing Not complainin\', but the best part of life is not even livin\' it Love sleepin\' and just usin\' the internet But my time is limited, and I better figure this Before I\'m slippin\' this opportunity, out my fingertips And let me just tell you what I have came to do Tryna\' show you I can rap as fast as I\'m able to Tryna\' show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I\'m breakin\' through And if a major record label is looking at me I\'m a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats I can rap fast, and rap slow I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so I\'m like MJ back when he had the afro Also, I\'m not black, so.. maybe not But before everyone gets angry, stop I\'m that person, then people naturally hate me, block All the people who keep on going crazy off \'Cause I won\'t be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got A lot of prominent features, I\'m a confident speaker With some dominant teachers I deserve to be starter, but constantly on the bleachers I\'m awfully small-achiever when I\'m up on the spot, and eager They be fearin\' this every time that they hearin\' it To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin\' a pyramid So when you\'re nearin\' this, please let me know When I\'m standin\' here frozen, please let it go Hear the metronome combined in the compilation To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation But that is just a dream, and probably a combination Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in But when I\'m playin\', just know it\'s all a big game I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name But when you think about it, it is all insane What can be created from chemicals in this brain But when you look at me, you lackin\' respect When I\'m crackin\' my neck so that I can rap to my chest Has in a breath, some say that it\'s magic, I step Until I\'m on the same stage, and you have it again But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame You think about how people used to sit and call you names And you check and wonder if it will be all the same Step back into reality, it all remains, damn   Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now On my computer-\'s breaking while I\'m doing this thirty-thousands words shit Hold on, uh Goddamn it   My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin\' just what I mean This is off the top, I don\'t need to use no machines Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can\'t do it forever But I am very clever Okay, okay, I\'m gonna take a drink, if you\'re watching this, take a drink too These are some shit\' that you can drink to But drink water unless you\'re of age You know what I\'m saying? Ayy   Okay, okay Uh Uh Ayy   I feel like I\'m way too different, ridiculous And most of humanity\'s made of idiots I barely even get myself, and you thinkin\' you understand? You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand? Please... what I do is barely poetry There\'s hope for me, I\'m noticing people starting to notice me But still consider me confident Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness But honestly, all of this, is haunting me, probably It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin\' It\'s tragic and not fleetin\', it follows me all evening It\'s calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away Yeah, we\'re just tryna find that great escape To get away from how we\'re living life day-to-day Some people find it in a drink or in a cup Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love But all I know is that it\'s tough And all I know is that this stuff isn\'t enough; it\'s way too much   I\'m Jong and Ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?

Man, I just live it up I\'m gonna go a little bit quieter now Uh-huh Yeah   All of these people keep on changin\' All of these times and different phases All of these lights, I know the stages All of these sights is so amazing Yeah, I\'ve seen at least a million faces A million times, a million places But when it\'s all said and done I look and I wonder why, uh   Everyone knows that it\'s so amazing, all the support is my motivation Compared to the big people at the Capital, my name is spelt in lower cases People loved me before I made it, people liked it before they watched it I\'m on a way too much more than I have, and I\'m glad, because now, I will never stop it Man on a mission, and I got a vision of talking a lot of wisdom, and I gotta listen Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow, I\'ll be the teacher when they need the feature Got flow, and it\'s so damn crazy, people consider me so amazing I\'m holding control and then folding them verses, I\'m hurt because I\'m on loaded bases Advancing, I know the basics, already know them, they\'re overrated than me Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hoping, because now I am open for game I\'m charged up, I ain\'t Drake, but I\'m on the worst behavior So many people they know the players, don\'t know the game and don\'t know the makers Don\'t know the fakers, but who cares? I\'m not here to cater, I\'m here to improve and show that I\'m greater I\'m here to go move and just go on the layers, and bitch, I am going so later I got time, my own lyrics, I got mine And I\'m on time for the wrong lines, and I\'m not crying, so let\'s start grinding, let\'s go   I\'ve been living life all on my own All on my own, people keep calling my phone Wanting to know when I\'ll be the star of the show But I\'m all my own, I\'m all on my own And I don\'t want to talk about it, stop to doubt it \'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but- The ghost of me is haunting the throne So I\'ll make it there all on my own   My intermission is mixing with intermissions And following intuition conflicting with my decision And it is more than just business, \'cause this is for self-approval And it is to make it look like I\'m living for something useful And it\'s sad, but you know it\'s true for most of you Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement Sue a new type of thing that you can gain from To push away the past and the places that you came from Day one for me was like six months ago-   Oh, holy shit! I actually reached the end of the beat But I still have, like Ten-thousand more words Hold on, I gotta pause this Hold on, three, it\'s still one-take!   -Past and the places that you came from Day one for me was like six months ago Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go Its not fun to know that we just livin\' to die We now know how much money you can give for a lie Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye? What\'s the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry? So, get your ass up, \'cause it\'s time to make it happen Always been shitty at rappin\', but I practice for the passion, man   Yeah, I\'ve been living life all on my own, bitch I ain\'t the star of the show, bitch   I know like four people who truly respect the grind And it\'s usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme And if time is money then free time ain\'t really free And sometimes I get pissed \'cause my own lyrics ain\'t really me They stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree I want to be what\'s taunting me, but sorry, I\'m a mini-me In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize To satisfy a lavish life and have a crazy magic time And luckily I\'m so damn young, \'cause, man, I have the time To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind I\'m trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I\'ve got Several different things to potentially make my job I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili\' subs And also get a mili\' plays, and maybe make a mili\' bucks A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really And once I get three million, I want four milli\' It\'s so silly, it\'s so tricky, this whole cycle We can never be happy, but that is so vital   Uh Those are actually some good lyrics Uh   Rebirth, feet

owner That\'s edgy like gravestones Oh, you get me I saved dough for a Bentley Two percent there already I may go for a Chevy \'Cause who cares about flexin\' if you ain\'t holding it heavy Uh, I\'ve

From that day, Better Dayz was everywhere with me, as I also had a CD player to listen to this album (uncovered in the box as well). In this current age of iPods and MP3s, of 2 Chainz and Drake, I had an ancient device that I valued like a diamond in the rough, obsessed over an album my peers knew or cared nothing for (When I was an eighth grader, I obviously had a wild social life)  I didn’t care. Sure, I listened to and loved rappers (Post-Blueprint Jay-Z, Eminem, T.I., and (regrettably) Lil Wayne), but Better Dayz was the first album I cherished, sparking a deeper passion for music than I once possessed. It would be disgraceful for me to not review this album before any other because, without this, I would have little love for rap (if at all). Without further delay, here’s my track-by-track review of Better Dayz.  Disc 1  1. Intro – This is the best way to begin an album. A reporter is at the unveiling of Better Dayz and she wonders where the songs are coming from since, you know, Pac was dead and all when this album was made. The fans in the background chant “Tu-Pac! Tu-Pac!” before they all count down the seconds for the release of Better Dayz.  2. Still Ballin’ – This is the first official song on the album, and it’s a mediocre one, lasting under three minutes, possessing a good-but-not-great beat, and featuring a rapper named Trick Daddy. Really? This is what the fans were hyped up about?  3. When We Ride On Our Enemies – Okay, this is a little better, with a beat that lets you know something amazing is about to happen, but (like “Still Ballin”) it’s under three minutes and is a mediocre song overall. Right now, the best thing about Better Dayz is the intro  4. Changed Man – Wow. This. Is. Amazing. The guitar instrumental is awesome, giving a laid-back mood to the song. Johntá Austin, this no-name singer, provides a phenomenal chorus while 2Pac and T.I. (the King of the South) trade verses about how they’re, well, “changed men”. This song is easily a highlight of Better Dayz.  5. F**k ‘Em All – And now we’re back to crap. Oh yeah, it also featured Outlawz, the duo that appeared in “Me Against the World”  6. Never B Peace – Hey, this song ain’t half bad (and the beat’s pretty good, too). As I look at whose featured (some nobodies named E.D.I and Kastro), I realize this was a lot better than I expected it to be  7. Mama’s Just A Little Girl – When people think of Pac’s classic ballads to the ladies, they’ll think of “Dear Mama” but this song was pretty good too. “Mama’s Just A Little Girl” has a soulful edge to it and 2Pac raps with passion on this track, but it’s Kimma Hill who dampens the songs brightness as she delivers a very unsatisfying chorus (there’s a reason why nobody’s heard of her). This is definitely no “Dear Mama”  8. Street Fame – Not many would attribute 2Pac’s legendary success to his lyricism or wordplay but, in this track, Shakur simply obliterated the mic (“Positive identification/ Got me rushed to the station”), and rappers should really collaborate more with Daz Dillinger (the producer who made this song’s beat) because he is a BEAST. Just listen to this sick piano instrumental for yourself. I’m ignoring that this song was from the `94 album Thug Life Vol. 1 to say “Street Fame” is one of Better Dayz’s finest tracks. As Pac said in this song “Lyrics’ll leave you spellbound.” They sure did  9. Whatcha Gonna Do? – You know what I’m going to do? Skip this song. Hey, thanks for asking  10. Fair XChange – At first, I hated this track but it slowly grew on me. As for the song itself, it’s one of 2Pac’s typical tracks dedicated to the ladies  11. Late Night – 2Pac ripped apart this song’s phenomenal beat, easily the best beat I’ve heard in this album  12. Ghetto Star – I can’t think of a more stereotypical song title and I can’t think of two more non-sensical stage names than this track’s guest rapper and producer (Nutt-So and Go-Twice, respectively). Because of this, I assume I’ll be listening to absolute garbage. Instead, I receive this intense instrumental accompanied by a super-serious Shakur, who once again brandished his lyrical excellence, providing an in-depth explanation of his struggles  13. Thugz Mansion (Acoustic) – I never understood what was so great about this. Yeah, there are some good aspects to this song (the beautiful guitar instrumental, and Nas spitting fire), but 2Pac’s rhymes were stolen form the original and J.Phoenix submitted a very sub-par chorus. It is what it is: a good-but-not-great rendition of a hip-hop classic (which will be in Disc 2)  (End of Disc 1)  Disc 2  1. My Block – This extraordinary guitar instrumental is present as 2Pac describes the struggles of the ghettos and he looks beyond that for hope. There’s also this group of little kids who form a first-class chorus. Disc 2 is definitely on a great start  2. Thugz Mansion – Over the years, I’ve listened to tons and tons of excellent songs, but this is still my all-time favorite. “Thugz Mansion” begins with Pac inventing the idea of a heaven for thugs like him, which leads into this masterpiece. To me, the beat isn’t that impressive but that’s the one flaw I found. On ‘Thugz Mansion”, 2Pac flaunts his lyrical excellence and injects his rhymes with unbridled passion. There’s also a notable rhyme in Verse 2 where Shakur says “Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us/ They’d rather see us locked in chains, please explain why they can’t stand us”, an idea that Kanye West expounded upon in his well-known song “New Slaves”. And don’t get me started on R&B legend Anthony Hamilton, who explodes into this track with an unrivaled chorus. If you’re going to listen to one song on Better Dayz, this is it (As an eighth grader, I pushed the repeat button so often that it broke)  3. Never Call You B**ch Again – It’s another excellent guitar instrumental, and Pac once again steps up his game. This song is about the rap legend gaining a newfound appreciation for the special woman who stood by him through thick and thin. Tyrese Gibson, who’s currently known as “that black guy” in the Fast and Furious franchise, is featured in this track and, while he’s definitely no Anthony Hamilton, he provides an amazing chorus. Disc 2 of Better Dayz is 3-for-3; there are no crappy tracks or sub-par songs as of right now  4. Better Dayz – The streak continues. The title track features a great chorus by Ron Isley, a soothing, reminiscing beat, and a spectacular Shakur (whose emotional performances on this album have become the norm). “Better Dayz” is a superb song all-around  5. U Can Call – We’re now 5-for-5! “U Can Call” is definitely a standout track in Better Dayz, a laid-back song about picking up women that features a phenomenal beat, the second-best beat on Better Dayz (“Late Night”, of course, is first), and an equally excellent chorus by Jazze Pha  6. Military Minds – The streak ends. I’m not saying this was a bad song. Actually, it was an awesome song with an amazing beat but “Military Minds” died when 2Pac continuously chanted “Where my thugs at”  7. Fame – The good times return. With the same song title as Young Jeezy’s immortal track (and the one great Snowman song I could find), this no-name producer (Hurt M Badd) creates a great beat as 2Pac and Outlawz tears it to bits. “Fame” also approaches a level of emotion that reminiscent of Disc 2’s earlier tracks as the pirate chant-like\xa0hook begins the song with “One thing we all adore/ Something worth dying for/ Nothing but pain/ Stuck in this game/ Searching for fortune and fame” (This song is one of Better Dayz’s finest, but I really want more from Pac)  8. Fair XChange (remix) – My ears are bleeding. This is by far the worst song Better Dayz has to offer, a much more insufferable track than “Whatcha Gonna Do?”, and that’s something nearly impossible to pull off. Skip this song  9. Catchin’ Feelins – Produced by E.D.I (the same guy who featured in “Never B Peace”), this track’s beat sounds suspiciously similar to the one in “Ghetto Star”. Overall, this is a pretty good song, nothing special (and it also features Outlawz)  10. There U Go – A laid-back song reminiscent of “Changed Man” and “Late Night”, this track is about Pac catching his woman cheating on him and how he feels about it. Big Syke (who collaborated with Pac on “All Eyez On Me”) is featured in here along with Outlawz, who surprisingly fit the mood of “There U Go” and temporarily resign from their usually intense rhymes  11. This Life I Lead – You can take one look at the song title and know exactly what this track is about. Like “Fame”, 2Pac inserts a single verse, a very good verse but still one verse, and delivers a mediocre hook. Also in this song is Outlawz (shocker), who steal 2Pac’s immortal line: “I ain’t a killa, but don’t push me.” Not one of Better Dayz’s finest  12. Who Do U Believe In? – Over the last couple of tracks, I wanted 2Pac to take over, to simply dominate, and he does on this one. Over the simplistic guitar instrumental, Pac gets deep, discussing religion on a level I haven’t heard since “Thugz Mansion”. Yaki Kadafi (an Outlawz member) makes an appearance and his mediocricy as a rapper, sort of obvious throughout this album, is on full display here. Despite the fact that “Who Do U Believe In?” was originally from the `99 compilation album Suge Knight Represent: Chronic 2000, this is a very good track in Better Dayz.  13. They Don’t Give A F**k About Us – The previous song would’ve been a great way to finish this album; instead, we’re stuck with this. Sure, this track’s theme was a deep one, about what happens when people die and if others will care about them, but overall it was a very second-rate song  14. Outro – Only thirteen seconds long, this is 2Pac saying he’ll come back from the dead and he says this twice. (End of Disc 2)  Conclusion  Everybody loved 2Pac, but when he died, they dismissed the albums that were released after that, claiming the posthumous albums were either not as good as the ones when he was alive or were copied material from Pac’s previous works. That might be true for the other posthumous albums but Better Dayz, with the exception of a few songs, is entirely original and this album, as a whole, is just as good as the ones Shakur created when he was alive  Don’t judge me, but honestly I was having (very small) doubts about whether or not 2Pac really is the greatest. Listening to Better Dayz crushed those doubts to smithereens and now I can continue to scream my loyalty to 2Pac Shakur, the one and only king of rap (R.I.P)  Top tracks  1. Thugz Mansion  2.

But that\'s where we are, that\'s my job, and that\'s what I\'m gonna do. But first, let me take a selfie.    Yes, The Chainsmokers. Or as they will always be known to me: The #SELFIE Guys. I am more shocked about their comeback than I was for Mike Posner\'s, and Posner was gone for three times as long. #SELFIE was just from 2014. And what makes it so shocking is that #SELFIE is the definiton of a novelty hit. It was exactly the kind of song that I should be able to dismiss as a blip from two idiots I would never see again. Of course, I\'ve been wrong about the career prospects of a lot of people, like, say, LMFAO, but they had their second song in the same year. If The Chainsmokers couldn\'t immediately follow up on their big hit, how on Earth could they return two years later?    I\'m annoyed by a lot of things about their comeback, but most of all, I\'m annoyed that I have to start taking them seriously as artists. The #SELFIE Guys are, in a quantifiable sense, the biggest act of the year. The Chainsmokers. If I could go back to 2014 and tell my past self that 2016 was the year of The Chainsmokers, past me would probably say, ""Wow, 2016 must be the worst in history!"" And I\'d tell him, ""Calm down! Things aren\'t that bad, hahaha, hahaha, also start investing in Xanax. And I mean now, not later.""  The big question is: ""How do you turn #SELFIE into a sustainable career?"" Good question! Well, apparently by switching from making terrible novelty EDM to terrible generic EDM... that\'s one possible way.    This was  one of the biggest hits of the year, and it is a disaster. Its an incoherent mish-mash of the worst sounds in pop music, and it of course was everywhere. The Black Eyed Peas may have been banished, but will.i.am\'s influence remains. But even that was dwarfed by today\'s song, which is A.) their attempt at a love song and B.) one where they actually sing. That\'s right, The #SELFIE Douches are now singing.    Oh... boy... Calvin Harris, I apologize.    Your voice is lovely, like the song of a beautiful wood thrush wafting on a summer breeze.  And because nothing in this world makes sense anymore, this song is huge. It is the best charting hit of the year. And, not speaking for myself, just taking the temperature of the room here, seems like the backlash is kicking in, but hard! And goddamn, I\'m not surprised. \'Cause, Jesus Christ, who on Earth thought this was a good idea? I daresay there\'s not a more disliked song in the world right now!  Am I really gonna be the guy to stand up for this? Fine, screw it. I like the song. Quite a bit, if I\'m being honest, but hear me out; I totally get why this song is controversial. There are a lot of problems with it. A lot! I mean, first off, Jesus Christ, it\'s a duet... with Halsey!    And, speaking of artists who made a terrible first impression! I was introduced to Halsey last year with her first mainstream success, ""New Americana,"" an anthem for the new millennial generation. Yeah, listen to that. Feel the creeping dread of the sweeping tide of change!   We are the new Americana High on legal marijuana  We smoke weed, legally! Watch us, obeying the law!   Raised on Biggie and Nirvana  That\'s not even your generation\'s music! If anything, those are two artists whose influences are being felt less and less! That has nothing to do with your generation, you\'re just trying to make the rest of us feel old! Yeah, every impression I got was that Halsey was like if Kesha was trying to be Lorde, which is not a combo that works.    But I gathered that was a fluke, and she\'s actually much more an anonymous singer than that, like she\'s not trying to make a statement, she\'s just another boring singer. So yeah, I don\'t like her, she was another demerit against ""Closer"". But I do like it anyway. Mostly, I like that it\'s such a songwriterly song. I don\'t know the last time we had a hit song packed with this much lyrical detail and intense emotion. It sketches a very full portrait of a very complex relationship between two people. And that level of detail is really remarkable in a day and age where you can have a hit song that just says ""Pineapple, pen, apple.""    Or ""You ugly, you ugly.""    And in it, the two of them are playing specific roles in the song. They\'re two long broken up exes reconnecting despite the years of tension between them. Todd: I, I should really just play the chorus here, because it is just fantastic! Andrew and Halsey: So baby pull me closer In the backseat of your Rover That I know you can\'t afford  Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder  We ain\'t ever getting older Todd: Okay, not that fantastic. Go back. Andrew and Halsey: Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder   Sorry. I do keep an actual record player down here  for uh, for when I need that sound. But um, anyway, yeah. I think it\'s important to say that lyrical detail is great. It adds a lot. But, not all details help paint the picture you\'re trying to create. For example...    ...I didn\'t need to know about Pat Monahan\'s manscaping habits. Pat: My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest  Not important to the story.  Back to ""Closer"" Andrew and Halsey: Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Todd (VO): Now, for example, the shoulder tattoo, that\'s an important detail, it adds to the scene. Andrew and Halsey: Backseat of your Rover  The Land Rover. Well, you know, it\'s part of the setting.  Andrew and Halsey: That I know you can\'t afford  Can she pay for it?  ...Um?  I, I guess it adds a level of familiarity with each other? ...But the mattress! Oh boy.  Andrew and Halsey: Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder  Do I need to know that there\'s a mattress? Yeah, that\'s uh, it\'s pretty important. But I don\'t need to know where she got the mattress, I don\'t need to know who she got the mattress from, and I certainly don\'t need to know where the person she got the mattress from is from! And it happens right before the most important line!  Andrew and Halsey: We ain\'t ever gettin\' older We ain\'t ever gettin\' older  That\'s what we were building up to! Except right before we hit peak momentum... mattress?! Boulder?! What?!  Video of a bicycle race  We\'re right at what should be the chorus\'s triumphant climax, and then...  The song plays over a cyclist riding a bike...  Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder ...and he falls off. Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder   This is the clumsiest, most useless, most jarringly unnecessary detail I\'ve ever seen a writer use! And I\'ve read  Dan Brown! And the fact that they\'re both singing the chorus together?  Andrew and Halsey: Baby pull me closer In the backseat of your Rover  That also raises some questions. Can they both not afford a Land Rover? Do they both have shoulder tattoos, are they both mattress thieves?  But, the fact that it\'s a duet makes some interesting things happen. Most especially, I like the fact that despite how they\'re sharing this moment together... these two people are having wildly different experiences!  Andrew: Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you I drink too much, and that\'s an issue But I\'m okay  I mean, the first thing the guy sings is basically...""Go away, I hate you!""   Andrew: Tell your friends it was nice to meet them But I hope I never see them again  Meanwhile, let\'s see how she feels about this rekindling of that old flame.  Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you I forget just why I left you I was insane  Why did you leave him? Hmm... Well, he hates all your friends!  Andrew: But I hope I never see them...  I\'m not saying it\'s his fault or your fault, I\'m just saying it\'s a huge red flag as far as compatibility goes. And of course, there\'s this.  Andrew: I drink too much, and that\'s an issue  Just a guess. But then again, by his own words, it\'s okay.  Andrew: But I\'m okay  So, I mean, don\'t worry about that obviously.I mean, focus on what\'s bringing the two of you together again.  Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you  Ah, yes! The one thing that proves a relationship can work forever: looks! It\'s like they say, ""Beauty is bone deep."" I, I don\'t know how to break it to ya... but I wouldn\'t count on him calling you the day after.  Andrew: Four years, no calls Now you\'re lookin\' pretty in a hotel bar  I mean, you haven\'t spoken in four years, which is not a good sign on its own. Plus, I get the feeling you might\'ve forgotten some bad memories. I mean, Christ, you\'ve re-met at a bar! The two of you only got back together because he\'s drunk! He drinks too much! It\'s an issue!  Halsey: I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city in a broke down car, and  This girl has completely missed that this guy\'s carrying more baggage than  a Samsonite store. Christ, the couple in  ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" were more on the same page!  Kimbra: Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over  I think these two crazy kids are gonna work it out!  Ah, young love.  Andrew: I know it breaks your heart  And even when they sing ""It breaks your heart,"" one\'s being completely sincere and the other\'s completely sarcastic. I mean, I guess it\'s kind of a dick move that the Chainsmokers wrote the girl as like being,  ""Wow, you\'re so hot,"" and... he never has to meet her halfway, he\'s just like ""You\'re a bitch,"" and she\'s just like,  ""God, sorry I\'m crazy!""  Halsey: I was insane  But, it, it still feels real, you know? The, the willful delusion of it all. See, it is a good song.  Halsey: Stay, and play that Blink-182 song That we beat to death in Tucson, okay   O-okay, I got questions again. Halsey: In Tucson, okay First off, Boulder? Tucson? What the hell was the two of you\'s relationship?! Were you traveling around the country like Bonnie and Clyde on a crazy mattress-stealing spree Secondly, ""that Blink-182 song""? Halsey: Play that Blink-182 song  Which one, the one with the dick jokes?    Mark Hoppus: The state looks down on sodomy  I know, I know, I\'m sorry,  I know they became a real grown-up band eventually.  But to me, they\'ll always be the  ""Haha, that porn star\'s gonna stick a finger up your butt"" band. Which, which song are they even talking about?  Let\'s see here.  Oh yeah, ""I Miss You."" Yeah that\'s a good song. I like that song.  Tom deLonge: Don\'t waste your time on me You\'re already the voice inside my head  Not sure it\'s all that romantic though. Not sure ""Don\'t waste your time on me"" is the lyric you really wanna hear when reconnecting. But yeah it does have some of the same  wistful vibe that this song has, you know, I\'ll give it that. Of course, if anything... the Blink-182 song she\'s talking about is still ""What\'s My Age Again?"" because that song is indeed about never getting older.  Mark: I never wanna act my age   And be honest, the situation will probably end up for these two looking like the same way it did for Blink. Embarrassing and regrettable in hindsight. This hookup is a mistake, you guys.  But I do have one other question:  Why is this being labelled a millennial anthem? \'Cause I\'ve seen that a lot. I\'ve been thinking about it, and... I think it\'s that a lot of the unnecessary jarring details are about... one major thing. Andrew: Moved to the city in a broke down car and   Can\'t buy a mattress, Daddy bought us a car, this is the new Americana. We\'re all broke. And we\'re gonna be a lot broker pretty soon, probably!  Oh no, no, no politics, no politics, no politics.    Andrew and Halsey: We ain\'t ever gettin\' older   Yeah, regardless of all its deep, serious flaws, I like it. I mean she\'s singing way too hard, and he can\'t sing at all, but... it works together, you know? Like Sonny & Cher, who are also both terrible singers; don\'t let anyone tell you otherwise.  Andrew and Halsey: We ain\'t ever gettin\' older  Look, I\'m not saying it\'s a perfect song, I\'m not sure it\'s even a good song. But if there\'s anything that sums up the mess of anger, optimism, confusion, and the desire to turn back time that I\'m feeling right now, it\'s this one. Chainsmokers, ""Closer,""... thumbs up.   Andrew and Halsey: No we ain\'t ever gettin\' older  ', "" Baby, what are we becoming?
