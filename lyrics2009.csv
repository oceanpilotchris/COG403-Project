From that day, Better Dayz was everywhere with me, as I also had a CD player to listen to this album (uncovered in the box as well). In this current age of iPods and MP3s, of 2 Chainz and Drake, I had an ancient device that I valued like a diamond in the rough, obsessed over an album my peers knew or cared nothing for (When I was an eighth grader, I obviously had a wild social life)  I didn’t care. Sure, I listened to and loved rappers (Post-Blueprint Jay-Z, Eminem, T.I., and (regrettably) Lil Wayne), but Better Dayz was the first album I cherished, sparking a deeper passion for music than I once possessed. It would be disgraceful for me to not review this album before any other because, without this, I would have little love for rap (if at all). Without further delay, here’s my track-by-track review of Better Dayz.  Disc 1  1. Intro – This is the best way to begin an album. A reporter is at the unveiling of Better Dayz and she wonders where the songs are coming from since, you know, Pac was dead and all when this album was made. The fans in the background chant “Tu-Pac! Tu-Pac!” before they all count down the seconds for the release of Better Dayz.  2. Still Ballin’ – This is the first official song on the album, and it’s a mediocre one, lasting under three minutes, possessing a good-but-not-great beat, and featuring a rapper named Trick Daddy. Really? This is what the fans were hyped up about?  3. When We Ride On Our Enemies – Okay, this is a little better, with a beat that lets you know something amazing is about to happen, but (like “Still Ballin”) it’s under three minutes and is a mediocre song overall. Right now, the best thing about Better Dayz is the intro  4. Changed Man – Wow. This. Is. Amazing. The guitar instrumental is awesome, giving a laid-back mood to the song. Johntá Austin, this no-name singer, provides a phenomenal chorus while 2Pac and T.I. (the King of the South) trade verses about how they’re, well, “changed men”. This song is easily a highlight of Better Dayz.  5. F**k ‘Em All – And now we’re back to crap. Oh yeah, it also featured Outlawz, the duo that appeared in “Me Against the World”  6. Never B Peace – Hey, this song ain’t half bad (and the beat’s pretty good, too). As I look at whose featured (some nobodies named E.D.I and Kastro), I realize this was a lot better than I expected it to be  7. Mama’s Just A Little Girl – When people think of Pac’s classic ballads to the ladies, they’ll think of “Dear Mama” but this song was pretty good too. “Mama’s Just A Little Girl” has a soulful edge to it and 2Pac raps with passion on this track, but it’s Kimma Hill who dampens the songs brightness as she delivers a very unsatisfying chorus (there’s a reason why nobody’s heard of her). This is definitely no “Dear Mama”  8. Street Fame – Not many would attribute 2Pac’s legendary success to his lyricism or wordplay but, in this track, Shakur simply obliterated the mic (“Positive identification/ Got me rushed to the station”), and rappers should really collaborate more with Daz Dillinger (the producer who made this song’s beat) because he is a BEAST. Just listen to this sick piano instrumental for yourself. I’m ignoring that this song was from the `94 album Thug Life Vol. 1 to say “Street Fame” is one of Better Dayz’s finest tracks. As Pac said in this song “Lyrics’ll leave you spellbound.” They sure did 9. Whatcha Gonna Do? – You know what I’m going to do? Skip this song. Hey, thanks for asking  10. Fair XChange – At first, I hated this track but it slowly grew on me. As for the song itself, it’s one of 2Pac’s typical tracks dedicated to the ladies  11. Late Night – 2Pac ripped apart this song’s phenomenal beat, easily the best beat I’ve heard in this album  12. Ghetto Star – I can’t think of a more stereotypical song title and I can’t think of two more non-sensical stage names than this track’s guest rapper and producer (Nutt-So and Go-Twice, respectively). Because of this, I assume I’ll be listening to absolute garbage. Instead, I receive this intense instrumental accompanied by a super-serious Shakur, who once again brandished his lyrical excellence, providing an in-depth explanation of his struggles  13. Thugz Mansion (Acoustic) – I never understood what was so great about this. Yeah, there are some good aspects to this song (the beautiful guitar instrumental, and Nas spitting fire), but 2Pac’s rhymes were stolen form the original and J.Phoenix submitted a very sub-par chorus. It is what it is: a good-but-not-great rendition of a hip-hop classic (which will be in Disc 2)  (End of Disc 1)  Disc 2  1. My Block – This extraordinary guitar instrumental is present as 2Pac describes the struggles of the ghettos and he looks beyond that for hope. There’s also this group of little kids who form a first-class chorus. Disc 2 is definitely on a great start  2. Thugz Mansion – Over the years, I’ve listened to tons and tons of excellent songs, but this is still my all-time favorite. “Thugz Mansion” begins with Pac inventing the idea of a heaven for thugs like him, which leads into this masterpiece. To me, the beat isn’t that impressive but that’s the one flaw I found. On ‘Thugz Mansion”, 2Pac flaunts his lyrical excellence and injects his rhymes with unbridled passion. There’s also a notable rhyme in Verse 2 where Shakur says “Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us/ They’d rather see us locked in chains, please explain why they can’t stand us”, an idea that Kanye West expounded upon in his well-known song “New Slaves”. And don’t get me started on R&B legend Anthony Hamilton, who explodes into this track with an unrivaled chorus. If you’re going to listen to one song on Better Dayz, this is it (As an eighth grader, I pushed the repeat button so often that it broke)  3. Never Call You B**ch Again – It’s another excellent guitar instrumental, and Pac once again steps up his game. This song is about the rap legend gaining a newfound appreciation for the special woman who stood by him through thick and thin. Tyrese Gibson, who’s currently known as “that black guy” in the Fast and Furious franchise, is featured in this track and, while he’s definitely no Anthony Hamilton, he provides an amazing chorus. Disc 2 of Better Dayz is 3-for-3; there are no crappy tracks or sub-par songs as of right now  4. Better Dayz – The streak continues. The title track features a great chorus by Ron Isley, a soothing, reminiscing beat, and a spectacular Shakur (whose emotional performances on this album have become the norm). “Better Dayz” is a superb song all-around  5. U Can Call – We’re now 5-for-5! “U Can Call” is definitely a standout track in Better Dayz, a laid-back song about picking up women that features a phenomenal beat, the second-best beat on Better Dayz (“Late Night”, of course, is first), and an equally excellent chorus by Jazze Pha  6. Military Minds – The streak ends. I’m not saying this was a bad song. Actually, it was an awesome song with an amazing beat but “Military Minds” died when 2Pac continuously chanted “Where my thugs at” 7. Fame – The good times return. With the same song title as Young Jeezy’s immortal track (and the one great Snowman song I could find), this no-name producer (Hurt M Badd) creates a great beat as 2Pac and Outlawz tears it to bits. “Fame” also approaches a level of emotion that reminiscent of Disc 2’s earlier tracks as the pirate chant-like\xa0hook begins the song with “One thing we all adore/ Something worth dying for/ Nothing but pain/ Stuck in this game/ Searching for fortune and fame” (This song is one of Better Dayz’s finest, but I really want more from Pac)  8. Fair XChange (remix) – My ears are bleeding. This is by far the worst song Better Dayz has to offer, a much more insufferable track than “Whatcha Gonna Do?”, and that’s something nearly impossible to pull off. Skip this song  9. Catchin’ Feelins – Produced by E.D.I (the same guy who featured in “Never B Peace”), this track’s beat sounds suspiciously similar to the one in “Ghetto Star”. Overall, this is a pretty good song, nothing special (and it also features Outlawz)  10. There U Go – A laid-back song reminiscent of “Changed Man” and “Late Night”, this track is about Pac catching his woman cheating on him and how he feels about it. Big Syke (who collaborated with Pac on “All Eyez On Me”) is featured in here along with Outlawz, who surprisingly fit the mood of “There U Go” and temporarily resign from their usually intense rhymes  11. This Life I Lead – You can take one look at the song title and know exactly what this track is about. Like “Fame”, 2Pac inserts a single verse, a very good verse but still one verse, and delivers a mediocre hook. Also in this song is Outlawz (shocker), who steal 2Pac’s immortal line: “I ain’t a killa, but don’t push me.” Not one of Better Dayz’s finest  12. Who Do U Believe In? – Over the last couple of tracks, I wanted 2Pac to take over, to simply dominate, and he does on this one. Over the simplistic guitar instrumental, Pac gets deep, discussing religion on a level I haven’t heard since “Thugz Mansion”. Yaki Kadafi (an Outlawz member) makes an appearance and his mediocricy as a rapper, sort of obvious throughout this album, is on full display here. Despite the fact that “Who Do U Believe In?” was originally from the `99 compilation album Suge Knight Represent: Chronic 2000, this is a very good track in Better Dayz.  13. They Don’t Give A F**k About Us – The previous song would’ve been a great way to finish this album; instead, we’re stuck with this. Sure, this track’s theme was a deep one, about what happens when people die and if others will care about them, but overall it was a very second-rate song  14. Outro – Only thirteen seconds long, this is 2Pac saying he’ll come back from the dead and he says this twice. (End of Disc 2)  Conclusion  Everybody loved 2Pac, but when he died, they dismissed the albums that were released after that, claiming the posthumous albums were either not as good as the ones when he was alive or were copied material from Pac’s previous works. That might be true for the other posthumous albums but Better Dayz, with the exception of a few songs, is entirely original and this album, as a whole, is just as good as the ones Shakur created when he was alive  Don’t judge me, but honestly I was having (very small) doubts about whether or not 2Pac really is the greatest. Listening to Better Dayz crushed those doubts to smithereens and now I can continue to scream my loyalty to 2Pac Shakur, the one and only king of rap (R.I.P)  Top tracks  1. Thugz Mansion 2.

But that\'s where we are, that\'s my job, and that\'s what I\'m gonna do. But first, let me take a selfie.    Yes, The Chainsmokers. Or as they will always be known to me: The #SELFIE Guys. I am more shocked about their comeback than I was for Mike Posner\'s, and Posner was gone for three times as long. #SELFIE was just from 2014. And what makes it so shocking is that #SELFIE is the definiton of a novelty hit. It was exactly the kind of song that I should be able to dismiss as a blip from two idiots I would never see again. Of course, I\'ve been wrong about the career prospects of a lot of people, like, say, LMFAO, but they had their second song in the same year. If The Chainsmokers couldn\'t immediately follow up on their big hit, how on Earth could they return two years later?    I\'m annoyed by a lot of things about their comeback, but most of all, I\'m annoyed that I have to start taking them seriously as artists. The #SELFIE Guys are, in a quantifiable sense, the biggest act of the year. The Chainsmokers. If I could go back to 2014 and tell my past self that 2016 was the year of The Chainsmokers, past me would probably say, ""Wow, 2016 must be the worst in history!"" And I\'d tell him, ""Calm down! Things aren\'t that bad, hahaha, hahaha, also start investing in Xanax. And I mean now, not later.""  The big question is: ""How do you turn #SELFIE into a sustainable career?"" Good question! Well, apparently by switching from making terrible novelty EDM to terrible generic EDM... that\'s one possible way.   This was  one of the biggest hits of the year, and it is a disaster. Its an incoherent mish-mash of the worst sounds in pop music, and it of course was everywhere. The Black Eyed Peas may have been banished, but will.i.am\'s influence remains. But even that was dwarfed by today\'s song, which is A.) their attempt at a love song and B.) one where they actually sing. That\'s right, The #SELFIE Douches are now singing.  Oh... boy... Calvin Harris, I apologize.  Your voice is lovely, like the song of a beautiful wood thrush wafting on a summer breeze. And because nothing in this world makes sense anymore, this song is huge. It is the best charting hit of the year. And, not speaking for myself, just taking the temperature of the room here, seems like the backlash is kicking in, but hard!And goddamn, I\'m not surprised. \'Cause, Jesus Christ, who on Earth thought this was a good idea? I daresay there\'s not a more disliked song in the world right now!  Am I really gonna be the guy to stand up for this? Fine, screw it. I like the song. Quite a bit, if I\'m being honest, but hear me out; I totally get why this song is controversial. There are a lot of problems with it. A lot! I mean, first off, Jesus Christ, it\'s a duet... with Halsey!    And, speaking of artists who made a terrible first impression! I was introduced to Halsey last year with her first mainstream success, ""New Americana,"" an anthem for the new millennial generation. Yeah, listen to that. Feel the creeping dread of the sweeping tide of change!   We are the new Americana High on legal marijuana  We smoke weed, legally! Watch us, obeying the law!   Raised on Biggie and Nirvana  That\'s not even your generation\'s music! If anything, those are two artists whose influences are being felt less and less! That has nothing to do with your generation, you\'re just trying to make the rest of us feel old! Yeah, every impression I got was that Halsey was like if Kesha was trying to be Lorde, which is not a combo that works.    But I gathered that was a fluke, and she\'s actually much more an anonymous singer than that, like she\'s not trying to make a statement, she\'s just another boring singer. So yeah, I don\'t like her, she was another demerit against ""Closer"". But I do like it anyway. Mostly, I like that it\'s such a songwriterly song. I don\'t know the last time we had a hit song packed with this much lyrical detail and intense emotion. It sketches a very full portrait of a very complex relationship between two people. And that level of detail is really remarkable in a day and age where you can have a hit song that just says ""Pineapple, pen, apple.""  Or ""You ugly, you ugly.""    And in it, the two of them are playing specific roles in the song. They\'re two long broken up exes reconnecting despite the years of tension between them. Todd: I, I should really just play the chorus here, because it is just fantastic! Andrew and Halsey: So baby pull me closer In the backseat of your Rover That I know you can\'t afford  Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder  We ain\'t ever getting older Todd: Okay, not that fantastic. Go back. Andrew and Halsey: Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder   Sorry. I do keep an actual record player down here  for uh, for when I need that sound. But um, anyway, yeah. I think it\'s important to say that lyrical detail is great. It adds a lot. But, not all details help paint the picture you\'re trying to create. For example...   ...I didn\'t need to know about Pat Monahan\'s manscaping habits. Pat: My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest Not important to the story.  Back to ""Closer"" Andrew and Halsey: Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Todd (VO): Now, for example, the shoulder tattoo, that\'s an important detail, it adds to the scene. Andrew and Halsey: Backseat of your Rover  The Land Rover. Well, you know, it\'s part of the setting.  Andrew and Halsey: That I know you can\'t afford  Can she pay for it?  ...Um?  I, I guess it adds a level of familiarity with each other? ...But the mattress! Oh boy.  Andrew and Halsey: Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder  Do I need to know that there\'s a mattress? Yeah, that\'s uh, it\'s pretty important. But I don\'t need to know where she got the mattress, I don\'t need to know who she got the mattress from, and I certainly don\'t need to know where the person she got the mattress from is from! And it happens right before the most important line!  Andrew and Halsey: We ain\'t ever gettin\' older We ain\'t ever gettin\' older  That\'s what we were building up to! Except right before we hit peak momentum... mattress?! Boulder?! What?!  Video of a bicycle race  We\'re right at what should be the chorus\'s triumphant climax, and then...  The song plays over a cyclist riding a bike...  Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder ...and he falls off. Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder   This is the clumsiest, most useless, most jarringly unnecessary detail I\'ve ever seen a writer use! And I\'ve read  Dan Brown! And the fact that they\'re both singing the chorus together?  Andrew and Halsey: Baby pull me closer In the backseat of your Rover  That also raises some questions. Can they both not afford a Land Rover? Do they both have shoulder tattoos, are they both mattress thieves?  But, the fact that it\'s a duet makes some interesting things happen. Most especially, I like the fact that despite how they\'re sharing this moment together... these two people are having wildly different experiences!  Andrew: Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you I drink too much, and that\'s an issue But I\'m okay  I mean, the first thing the guy sings is basically...""Go away, I hate you!""   Andrew: Tell your friends it was nice to meet them But I hope I never see them again  Meanwhile, let\'s see how she feels about this rekindling of that old flame.  Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you I forget just why I left you I was insane  Why did you leave him? Hmm... Well, he hates all your friends!  Andrew: But I hope I never see them...  I\'m not saying it\'s his fault or your fault, I\'m just saying it\'s a huge red flag as far as compatibility goes. And of course, there\'s this.  Andrew: I drink too much, and that\'s an issue  Just a guess. But then again, by his own words, it\'s okay.  Andrew: But I\'m okay  So, I mean, don\'t worry about that obviously.I mean, focus on what\'s bringing the two of you together again.  Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you  Ah, yes! The one thing that proves a relationship can work forever: looks! It\'s like they say, ""Beauty is bone deep."" I, I don\'t know how to break it to ya... but I wouldn\'t count on him calling you the day after.  Andrew: Four years, no calls Now you\'re lookin\' pretty in a hotel bar  I mean, you haven\'t spoken in four years, which is not a good sign on its own. Plus, I get the feeling you might\'ve forgotten some bad memories. I mean, Christ, you\'ve re-met at a bar! The two of you only got back together because he\'s drunk! He drinks too much! It\'s an issue!  Halsey: I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city in a broke down car, and  This girl has completely missed that this guy\'s carrying more baggage than  a Samsonite store. Christ, the couple in  ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" were more on the same page!  Kimbra: Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over  I think these two crazy kids are gonna work it out!  Ah, young love.  Andrew: I know it breaks your heart  And even when they sing ""It breaks your heart,"" one\'s being completely sincere and the other\'s completely sarcastic. I mean, I guess it\'s kind of a dick move that the Chainsmokers wrote the girl as like being,  ""Wow, you\'re so hot,"" and... he never has to meet her halfway, he\'s just like ""You\'re a bitch,"" and she\'s just like,  ""God, sorry I\'m crazy!""  Halsey: I was insane  But, it, it still feels real, you know? The, the willful delusion of it all. See, it is a good song.  Halsey: Stay, and play that Blink-182 song That we beat to death in Tucson, okay   O-okay, I got questions again. Halsey: In Tucson, okay First off, Boulder? Tucson? What the hell was the two of you\'s relationship?! Were you traveling around the country like Bonnie and Clyde on a crazy mattress-stealing spree Secondly, ""that Blink-182 song""? Halsey: Play that Blink-182 song  Which one, the one with the dick jokes?    Mark Hoppus: The state looks down on sodomy  I know, I know, I\'m sorry,  I know they became a real grown-up band eventually.  But to me, they\'ll always be the  ""Haha, that porn star\'s gonna stick a finger up your butt"" band. Which, which song are they even talking about?  Let\'s see here.  Oh yeah, ""I Miss You."" Yeah that\'s a good song. I like that song.  Tom deLonge: Don\'t waste your time on me You\'re already the voice inside my head  Not sure it\'s all that romantic though. Not sure ""Don\'t waste your time on me"" is the lyric you really wanna hear when reconnecting. But yeah it does have some of the same  wistful vibe that this song has, you know, I\'ll give it that. Of course, if anything... the Blink-182 song she\'s talking about is still ""What\'s My Age Again?"" because that song is indeed about never getting older.  Mark: I never wanna act my age   And be honest, the situation will probably end up for these two looking like the same way it did for Blink. Embarrassing and regrettable in hindsight. This hookup is a mistake, you guys.  But I do have one other question:  Why is this being labelled a millennial anthem? \'Cause I\'ve seen that a lot. I\'ve been thinking about it, and... I think it\'s that a lot of the unnecessary jarring details are about... one major thing. Andrew: Moved to the city in a broke down car and   Can\'t buy a mattress, Daddy bought us a car, this is the new Americana. We\'re all broke. And we\'re gonna be a lot broker pretty soon, probably!  Oh no, no, no politics, no politics, no politics.    Andrew and Halsey: We ain\'t ever gettin\' older   Yeah, regardless of all its deep, serious flaws, I like it. I mean she\'s singing way too hard, and he can\'t sing at all, but... it works together, you know? Like Sonny & Cher, who are also both terrible singers; don\'t let anyone tell you otherwise.  Andrew and Halsey: We ain\'t ever gettin\' older  Look, I\'m not saying it\'s a perfect song, I\'m not sure it\'s even a good song. But if there\'s anything that sums up the mess of anger, optimism, confusion, and the desire to turn back time that I\'m feeling right now, it\'s this one. Chainsmokers, ""Closer,""... thumbs up.   Andrew and Halsey: No we ain\'t ever gettin\' older  ', "" Say Foxx? (Yeah-eah-eah...) I had, I had a chick man (Yeah-eah-eah...) She went and did me real wrong, I mean (Yeah-eah-eah...) I did the same thing to her but She ain't have no right to do me like that though dawg, for real (Yeah-eah-eah...)

The service launches March 30, 2015. The artists are performing a ‘Coup d\'état’ style campaign to overthrow Spotify, on the eve of its rumoured $16B acquisition.   Mashable.com writes: Earlier this year, Jay Z bought Aspiro, a Swedish tech company that runs two streaming music services (WiMP and Tidal) for $56 million. Monday\'s announcement will finally reveal what the 45-year-old rap mogul will do with his purchase.  Tidal\'s website describes the service as such: ""Introducing the first music streaming service that combines the best High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial.""   Consequenceofsound.com writes: A new high-fidelity streaming music service helmed by Jay Z launches Monday. TIDAL was acquired by the rapper last month as part of a $56 million dollar deal with the Scandinavian platform Aspiro.   Full details of the service will be announced during a press conference on Monday. However, according to TIDAL’s website, it’s “the first music streaming service that combines the best High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial.”   There are two paid subscription options: $19.99 a month for high-fidelity audio, and $9.99 for standard quality audio. TIDAL can be streamed on the web, and downloaded for iOS and Android devices. Several artists have already thrown their support behind TIDAL, changing their Twitter icons to light blue and tweeting the hashtag #TIDALForAll. Among them were Kanye West and Jack White’s Third Man Records TIDAL joins the ranks of an already crowded streaming music market, which includes Spotify, Rdio, Amazon, Pandora, and Neil Young’s high-fidelity PONO digital store. Additionally, Apple is said to be developing its own service with the assistance of Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor.   USA Today writes: Music mogul Jay Z is expected on Monday to unveil his blueprint for high-resolution music streaming service Tidal. A press invite for an event scheduled for Monday went out last week promising that “Shawn ‘JAY Z’ Carter and special guests will announce a commitment to a new direction for the music industry from both a creative and business perspective.”  The hip-hop icon last month made a $56 million bid for the service and parent company Aspiro through Project Panther Bidco Ltd., which is indirectly-owned by his S. Carter Enterprises. The Scandinavian company Aspiro currently operates two music services, Tidal in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and WiMP, in Norway, Sweden and other parts of Europe.   The two services will now be operated under the name Tidal worldwide. The event, which will be live-streamed, will unveil “a new chapter” for the global streaming service.   Jay Z’s play with Tidal comes at a tumultuous time for the music streaming market. Apple is reportedly revamping its streaming music plan. The tech giant acquired Beats Music last year for $3 billion, but is now planning a new streaming service to better compete with Spotify, The New York Times reported last week.   Apple had hoped to undercut Spotify on its $9.99 monthly paid tier of service by $2, but music labels would not agree to Apple’s offer for lower licensing fees, sources told the Times.   This is part of an aggressive move by the major labels, specifically Universal, Sony and Warner Music to limit or close free access streaming, says Paul Resnikoff, publisher of Digital Music News.   “They’ve lost faith in the ability of ‘freemium’ to covert enough paid subscribers, where the real money in streaming comes from,” he said. “That explains the refusal to allow a free tier on Apple’s upcoming streaming launch, and now, a refusal to even let Apple offer a lower price point.”   A reason why the music industry might embrace Jay Z and Tidal? It charges $19.99 monthly for unlimited listening of high resolution music — with no free listening tier, although you can get a seven-day free trial.   Tidal’s music quality offerings include 1411 kilobits per second lossless HiFi, which is equivalent to CD sound and considered higher quality than lower resolution levels of Spotify (320 kbps) and iTunes (256 kbps).   Users can access Tidal on Android and iOS devices, computers and some home audio products including Sonos speakers.', "" Ron Browz, yes!
