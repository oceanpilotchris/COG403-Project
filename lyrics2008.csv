SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL, DAY  The text on screen shatters and reveals an establishing shot of Shermer High School. Brian’s voice begins to narrate.  BRIAN: Saturday, March 24th, 1984. Shermer High School. Shermer, Illinois, 60062.  Cut to various shots from inside the high school as Brian continues to narrate.  BRIAN: Dear Mr. Vernon. We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did was wrong, but we think you’re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. What do you care? You see us as you want to see us. In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, princess, and a criminal. Correct? That’s the way we saw each other at seven o’clock this morning. We were brainwashed.  Outside the school, Claire sits in a car with her father.  CLAIRE: I can’t believe you can’t get me out of this. It’s so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday. It’s not like I’m a defective or anything.  Claire’s dad sighs and turns to her.  CLAIRE’S DAD: I’ll make it up to you.  He hands her a bag from the back seat..  CLAIRE’S DAD: Honey, ditching class to go shopping doesn’t make you a defective. Have a good day.  She gets out of the car. Cut to Brian in a car with his mother and younger sister.  BRIAN’S MOM: Is this the first or the last time we do this?  BRIAN: Last.  BRIAN’S MOM: Well, get in there and use the time to your advantage.  BRIAN: Mom, we’re not supposed to study. We just have to sit there and do nothing.  BRIAN’S MOM: Well, mister, you figure out a way to study.  BRIAN’S SISTER: Yeah.  BRIAN’S MOM: Well, go!  He gets out of the car. Cut to Andrew in a car with his dad.  ANDREW’S DAD: Hey, I screwed around. Guys screw around. There’s nothing wrong with that, except you got caught, sport.  ANDREW: Yeah, mom already reamed me, all right?  ANDREW’S DAD: You want to miss a match? You want to blow your ride?  Andrew shakes his head.  ANDREW’S DAD: Now, no school is going to give a scholarship to a discipline case.  Andrew gets out of the car. Andrew’s dad drives away. John walks up and almost gets hit by Allison’s car, but just keeps walking. Allison gets out. She walks to the passenger side, but the car pulls away.  CUT TO: INT. DETENTION ROOM  Claire is seated in the front row. Brian sits in the row behind her. Andrew enters. He gestures to a seat near Claire. She smiles and shrugs, and he sits down. John enters and steals something from a desk. He walks to Brian and gestures for him to move. Brian gets out of his seat and moves to a different one. John pulls out two chairs and lays across them. Allison enters and sits in the far back. Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. Vernon enters.  VERNON: Well, well. Here we are. I want to congratulate you for being on time.  Claire raises her hand.  CLAIRE: Excuse me, sir? I think there\'s been a mistake. I know it\'s detention, but, um... I don\'t think I belong in here.  Vernon ignores her and checks his watch. As he speaks we see the reactions of the students  VERNON: It is now 7:06. You have exactly 8 hours and 54 minutes to think about why you\'re here. To ponder the error of your ways. And you may not talk. You will not move from these seats. And you-  He takes one of the chairs John is laying across and moves it.  VERNON: -will not sleep. All right, people, we\'re gonna try something a little different today. We are going to write an essay of no less than a thousand words describing to me who you think you are.  He hands out paper to the students.  JOHN: Is this a test?  VERNON: And when I say ""essay,"" I mean essay. I do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times. Is that clear, Mr. Bender?  JOHN: Crystal.  VERNON: Good. Maybe you\'ll learn a little something about yourself. Maybe you\'ll even decide whether or not you care to return.  Brian raises his hand and stands up.  BRIAN: Uh, you know, I can answer that right now, sir. You know, that\'d be ""no."" ""No"" for me, \'cause-  VERNON: Sit down, Johnson.  BRIAN: Thank you, sir.  Brian sits down.  VERNON: My office is right across that hall. Any monkey business is ill-advised. Any questions?  JOHN: Yeah, I got a question. Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?  VERNON: I\'ll give you the answer to that question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday. Don\'t mess with the bull, young man. You\'ll get the horns.  Vernon walks to his office.  JOHN: That man is a brownie hound.  Allison begins loudly biting her nails. The other students look at her. She notices, but doesn’t stop.  JOHN: You keep eating your hand, you\'re not gonna be hungry for lunch.  She spits a nail at him.  JOHN: I\'ve seen you before, you know.  BRIAN: Who do I think I am? Who are you?  Brian sticks his pen in his mouth and plays with it.  BRIAN: I’m a walrus.  John gives him a look. Brian takes the pen out. John takes off his scarf. They both go to take their jackets off at the same time and stare at each other. Brian relents and leaves his on. John stares intently at Brian.  BRIAN: It’s the shits, huh?  John turns away, then crumples up paper and throws it to the front of the room. He begins humming.  CLAIRE: I can’t believe this is really happening to me.  JOHN: Oh, shit! What are we supposed to do if we have to take a piss?  CLAIRE: Please.  JOHN: If you gotta go, you gotta go.  He unzips his pants.  CLAIRE: Oh, my god.  ANDREW: Hey, you’re not urinating in here, man.  JOHN: Don’t talk, don’t talk. It makes it crawl back up.  ANDREW: You whip it out and you’re dead before the first drop hits the floor.  JOHN: God. You’re pretty sexy when you get angry.  He turns to Brian.  JOHN: Hey, homeboy. Why don’t you go close that door, we’ll get the prom queen impregnated?  ANDREW: Hey. Hey!  JOHN: What?  ANDREW: If I lose my temper you’re totaled, man.  JOHN: Totally?  ANDREW: Totally.  CLAIRE: Why don’t you just shut up? Nobody here is interested.  JOHN: Really.  ANDREW: Buttface.  JOHN: Well hey, sporto, what’d you do to get in here? Forget to wash your jock?  BRIAN: Excuse me, fellas, I think we should just write out papers.  ANDREW: Look, just because you live in here doesn’t give you the right to be a pain in the ass, so knock it off.  JOHN: It’s a free country.  CLAIRE: He’s just doing it to get a rise out of you. Just ignore him.  JOHN: Sweets.  Claire turns to him.  JOHN: You couldn’t ignore me if you tried. So… So, are you guys like, boyfriend-girlfriend? Steady dates? Lovers? Come on, sporto. Level with me. Do you slip her the hot beef injection?  CLAIRE: Go to hell!  ANDREW: Enough!  VERNON: Hey, what’s going on in there?  Vernon sits in his office, reading a newspaper.  VERNON: Spoiled little pricks.  He doesn’t get up. Cut back to the detention room.  ANDREW: Scumbag.  John gets up and sits on a railing.  JOHN: What do you say we close that door? We can\'t have any kind of party with Vernon checking us out every few seconds.  BRIAN: You know, the door\'s supposed to stay open.  JOHN: So what?  ANDREW: So why don\'t you just shut up? There\'s four other people in here, you know.  JOHN: God, you can count. See, I knew you had to be smart to be a, a wrestler.  ANDREW: Who the hell are you to judge anybody, anyway?  CLAIRE: Really.  ANDREW: You know, Bender, you don\'t even count. I mean if you disappeared forever it wouldn\'t make any difference. You may as well not even exist at this school.  JOHN: Well, I\'ll just run right out and join the wrestling team. Maybe the prep club, too. Student council.  ANDREW: Nah. They wouldn\'t take you.  JOHN: I\'m hurt.  CLAIRE: You know why guys like you knock everything?  JOHN: Oh, this should be stunning.  CLAIRE: It\'s \'cause you\'re afraid.  JOHN: Oh, God. You richies are so smart; that\'s exactly why I\'m not heavy in activities.  CLAIRE: You\'re a big coward.  BRIAN: I\'m in the math club.  CLAIRE: See, you\'re afraid that they won\'t take you. You don\'t belong, so you just have to dump all over it.  JOHN: Well, it wouldn\'t have anything to do with you activities people being assholes, now would it?  CLAIRE: Well you wouldn\'t know; you don\'t even know any of us.  JOHN: Well, I don\'t know any lepers, either, but I\'m not gonna run out and join one of their fucking clubs.  ANDREW: Uh, let\'s watch the mouth, huh?  BRIAN: Um, uh, this is a Club, too.  JOHN: Excuse me a sec. What are you babbling about?  BRIAN: Well, what I’d said was, I\'m in the Math Club, uh, the Latin Club, and the Physics Club. Physics Club.  JOHN: Hey, Cherry. Do you belong to the Physics Club?  CLAIRE: That\'s an academic club.  JOHN: So?  CLAIRE: So, academic clubs aren\'t the same as other kinds of clubs.  JOHN: Ah, but to dorks like him, they are. What do you guys do in your club?  BRIAN: In physics, well, we, we, uh, we talk about physics. Uh, properties of physics.  JOHN: So it\'s sort of social. Demented and sad, but social, right?  BRIAN: Yeah, well, I guess you could consider it a social situation. I mean, there are other children in my club, and at the end of the year, we have, we have, you know, a big banquet at the Hilton.  JOHN: You load up, you party.  BRIAN: Well, no, well, we get dressed up. I mean, but we don’t get high.  CLAIRE: Only burners like you get high.  BRIAN: And I didn’t have any shoes, so I had to borrow my dad’s. It was kind of weird because my mom doesn’t like me to wear other people’s shoes. And my cousin Ken- my cousin Kendall, from Indiana, he got high once-  Allison mimes shooting Brian behind his back.  BRIAN: -and he started eating really weird foods, and um, and then he just felt like he didn’t belong anywhere, you know, kind of, like, you know, Twilight Zone, kind of.  CLAIRE: Sounds like you.  ANDREW: Look, you guys keep up your talking and Vernon\'s gonna come right in here. I got a meet this Saturday and I\'m not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads.  JOHN: Oh and wouldn\'t that be a bite, huh? Missing a whole wrestling meet!  ANDREW: Well, you wouldn\'t know anything about it, faggot! You never competed in your whole life!  JOHN: Oh, I know. I feel all empty inside because of it. I have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys.  ANDREW: Ah, you\'d never miss it. You don\'t have any goals.  JOHN: Oh, but I do!  ANDREW: Yeah?  JOHN: I wanna be just like you. I figure all I need\'s a lobotomy and some tights!  BRIAN: You wear tights?  ANDREW: No, I don\'t wear tights. I wear the required uniform.  BRIAN: Tights.  ANDREW: Shut up!  Allison smirks and scribbles. Vernon makes a noise in his office and the kids peer around the corner to see him up and walking around. John makes a show of sitting between Claire and Andrew. Vernon ends up going down the hallway away from the detention room. John gets up and heads for the door.  BRIAN: You know, there’s not supposed to be any, uh, monkey business.  JOHN: Young man, have you finished your paper?  John fiddles with latches on the door.  ANDREW: Come on, Bender, don’t screw around.  CLAIRE: What are you gonna do?  ANDREW: Drop dead, I hope.  Cut to Vernon elsewhere in the building. He inspects a reflection of himself and says something incoherent. Cut back to the detention room.  BRIAN: Bender, that’s school property there. I mean, that’s, you know, it doesn’t belong to us and it’s something that’s not to be toyed with.  John closes the door.  ANDREW: That’s very funny. Come on, fix it!  BRIAN: You should really fix that.  John sits back down.  JOHN: Am I a genius?  ANDREW: No, you’re an asshole.  JOHN: What a funny guy.  ANDREW: Fix the door, Bender.  JOHN: Everyone just shh!  Cut in the hallway, Vernon returns and hears the conversation through the door.  JOHN: Listen, I’ve been here before, I know what I’m doing.  ANDREW: No, fix the door! Get up there and fix it!  JOHN: Shut up!  VERNON: Goddamn it!  He bursts in.  VERNON: Why is that door closed?  No one responds.  VENON: Why is that door closed?  JOHN: How are we supposed to know? We’re not supposed to move, right?  Vernon looks at Claire.  VERNON: Why?  CLAIRE: We’re just sitting here, like we’re supposed to.  VERNON: Who closed that door?  JOHN: I think a screw fell out of it.  ANDREW: It just closed, sir.  VERNON: Who?  Allison squeals and slams her face on the table.  JOHN: She doesn’t talk, sir.  VERNON: Give me that screw.  JOHN: I don’t have it.  VERNON: You want me to yank you out of that seat and shake it out of you?  JOHN: I don’t have it. Screws fall out all the time. The world’s an imperfect place.  VERNON: Give it to me, Bender.  CLAIRE: Excuse me, sir, why would anybody want to steal a screw?  VERNON: Watch it, young lady.  Vernon leaves in a huff. He tries to open the door, but it falls shut. He grabs a chair.  JOHN: The door’s way too heavy, sir.  Vernon attempts to prop the door open with the chair, but the door still swings shut, swatting the chair out of the way. He shouts and the kids try to conceal their laughter. Vernon comes back in.  VERNON: Andrew Clark. Get up here. Come on, front and center. Let’s go.  Andrew sighs and gets up.  JOHN: Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?  Vernon instructs Andrew to help him carry a large shelving unit to the door.  JOHN: If he gets up we’ll all get up. It’ll be anarchy!  VERNON: Okay, watch it, watch the magazines.  The carry the unit through the door.  JOHN: It’s out of my hands.  With the door propped open, Andrew clumsily tries to get back inside, but slips. Vernon tries to help him up.  JOHN: That’s very clever, sir. But what if there’s a fire? I think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir.  VERNON: Alright, what are you doing with this? What are you doing with this? Get out of here, for god’s sake. What’s the matter with you? Come on.  BRIAN: Well, you know the school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library.  JOHN: Show Dick some respect.  Vernon prods Andrew back to the seats.  VERNON: Let’s go. Go, get back in your seat.  Andrew sits down.  VERNON: I expected a little more from a varsity letterman. You’re not fooling anybody, Bender. The next screw that falls out is going to be you.  JOHN: (Muttering) Eat my shorts.  VERNON: What was that?  JOHN: Eat my shorts.  VERNON: You just bought yourself another Saturday, mister.  JOHN: Oh, I’m crushed.  VERNON: You just bought one more right there.  JOHN: Well, I’m free the Saturday after that. Beyond that, I’m going to have to check my calendar.  VERNON: Good, because it’s going to be filled! We’ll keep going. You want another one? Say the word, just say the word. Instead of going to prison you’ll come here. Are you through?  JOHN: No.  VERNON: I’m doing society a favor.  JOHN: So?  VERNON: That’s another one, right now. I’ve got you for the rest of your natural born life if you don’t watch your step. You want another one?  JOHN: Yes.  VERNON: You got it! You got another one right there. That’s another one, pal.  CLAIRE: Cut it out!  She mouths stop at him.  VERNON: You through?  JOHN: Not even close, bud.  VERNON: Good, you got one more right there.  JOHN: You really think I give a shit?  VERNON: Another.  John just stares.  VERNON: You through?  JOHN: How many is that?  BRIAN: That’s seven including when we first came in and you asked Mr. Vernon here whether Barry Manilow knew that he raided his closet.  VERNON: Now it’s eight. You stay out of it.  BRIAN: Excuse me, sir, it’s seven.  VERNON: Shut up, Pee Wee.  Vernon holds up two fingers.  VERNON: You’re mine, Bender. For two months I got you. I got you.  JOHN: What can I say? I’m thrilled.  VERNON: Oh, I’m sure that’s exactly what you want these people to believe. You know something, Bender? You ought to spend a little more time trying to do something with yourself and a little less time trying to impress people. You might be better off. Alright, that’s it. I’m going to be right outside those doors. The next time I have to come in here, I’m cracking skulls.  He walks out, holding two fingers up to John one last time before the door closes. Noise builds up.  JOHN: Fuck you! Fuck.  Cut to a close up of a clock which shows 7:45. John strikes a match on his shoe and uses it to light a cigarette. Claire stares off into the distance. Brian covers his crotch with his hat. Andrew plays with the strings on his hoodie. Allison holds up a string. John hits the fire on his shoe, putting it out. Allison ties the string around her finger, cutting off circulation to the tip. John plays air-guitar. Allison draws a detailed piece of art. Andrew plays paper football. Allison scratches her hair, getting dandruff all over her drawing. The kids all struggle to stay awake. Cut to Vernon staring at them all with contempt.  VERNON: Wake up!  None of the kids respond.  VERNON: Who has to go to the lavatory?  The kids all raise their hands. Cut to the clock again, now a little past 10:20. John sits on a desk ripping something up. Brian stands nearby reading something. Andrew stretches his leg on a railing. Claire sits, looking bored. John throws papers everywhere.  ANDREW: That’s real intelligent.  JOHN: You’re right. It’s wrong to destroy literature. It’s such fun to read. And…  He reads the name of the author off of the book he’s ripping up.  JOHN: “Mollay” really pumps my nads.  Claire smiles at John.  CLAIRE: Molière.  Classical music plays.  BRIAN: I love his work.   John angrily throws paper at Brian and puts the book down.  JOHN: Big deal. Nothing to do when you’re locked in a vacancy.  He picks up a drawer of index cards.  ANDREW: Ah, speak for yourself.  JOHN: Do you think I’d speak for you? I don’t even know your language.  Andrew turns away from John to Claire.  ANDREW: Hey, you grounded tonight?  CLAIRE: I don’t know. My mom said I was, but my dad told me just to blow her off.  Andrew gives a pointed look to John before continuing.  ANDREW: There’s a big party at Stubby’s. Parents are in Europe. Should be pretty wild.  CLAIRE: Yeah?  ANDREW: Yeah, you gonna go?  CLAIRE: I doubt it.  ANDREW: How come?  CLAIRE: Well, cause if I do what my mother tells me not to do, it’s because my father says it’s okay. It’s this whole big monster deal. It’s endless. It’s a total drag. It’s like any minute, divorce.  JOHN: Who do you like better?  CLAIRE: What?  JOHN: You like your old man better than your mom?  CLAIRE: They’re both screwed.  JOHN: No, I mean, if you had to choose between them.  CLAIRE: I don’t know. Probably go live with my brother. I mean, I don’t think either one of them gives a shit about me. It’s like they use me just to get back at each other.  ALLISON: Ha!  Claire, John, and Brian look at Allison in confusion. Andrew smiles. Allison blows hair out of her own face.  CLAIRE: Shut up.  ANDREW: You’re just feeling sorry for yourself.  CLAIRE: Yeah, well, if I didn’t, nobody else would.  ANDREW: Aw, you’re breaking my heart.  JOHN: Sporto?  ANDREW: What?  John hops down from the desk.  JOHN: You get along with your parents?  ANDREW: Well, if I say yes I’m an idiot, right?  John hops over the railing in front of Andrew.  JOHN: You’re an idiot anyway. But if you say you get along with your parents, well you’re a liar too.  John walks away. Andrew follows and shoves him from behind.  ANDREW: You know something, man? If we weren’t in school right now I’d waste you.  John holds up his hand.  JOHN: Can you hear this? You want me to turn it up?  He turns his hand up, flipping off Andrew. Brian walks into frame and tries to get between them.  BRIAN: Hey, fellas, I mean-  He reaches his arms around them, but they both shove him off. Andrew takes a few steps away.  BRIAN: I don’t, I don’t like my parents either, I mean, I don’t, you know, I don’t, I don’t get along with them, and their idea of, you know, parental compassion is just, you know, whacko, you know?  JOHN: Dork?  BRIAN: Yeah?  JOHN: You are a parent’s wet dream, okay?  He pats Brian, who stumbles back onto a desk.  BRIAN: Well, that’s the problem.  JOHN: Look, I can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kind of clothes, but face it. You’re a neo-maxi-zoon-dweebie. What would you be doing if you weren’t out making yourself a better citizen?  ANDREW: Why do you have to insult everybody?  JOHN: I’m being honest, asshole. I would expect you to know the difference.  ANDREW: Yeah, well he’s got a name.  JOHN: Yeah?  ANDREW: Yeah. What’s your name?  BRIAN: Brian.  ANDREW: See?  JOHN: My condolences.  CLAIRE: What\'s your name?  JOHN: What\'s yours?  CLAIRE: Claire.  JOHN: Claire?  CLAIRE: Claire. It\'s a family name.  JOHN: No, it\'s a fat girl\'s name.  CLAIRE: Oh, thank you.  JOHN: You\'re welcome.  CLAIRE: I\'m not fat.  JOHN: Well, not at present, but I could see you really pushing maximum density. You see, I\'m not sure if you know this, but there are two kinds of fat people. There\'s fat people that were born to be fat, and there\'s fat people that were once thin, but they became fat, so when you look at them you can sort of see that thin person inside. You see, you\'re gonna get married, you\'re gonna squeeze out a few puppies and then, uh…  He imitates bloating up. She flips him off.  JOHN: Oh, obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl.  CLAIRE: I\'m not that pristine.  He leans in closer.  JOHN: Are you a virgin? I\'ll bet you a million dollars that you are. Let\'s end the suspense. Is it gonna be a...white weddin\'?  CLAIRE: Why don\'t you just shut up?  JOHN: Have you ever kissed a boy on the mouth? Have you ever been felt up, over the bra, under the blouse, shoes off, hoping to God your parents don\'t walk in?  CLAIRE: Do you want me to puke?  JOHN: Over the panties, no bra, blouse unbuttoned, Calvin\'s in a ball on the front seat past 11:00 on a school night?  ANDREW: Leave her alone.  John doesn’t move. Andrew walks closer.  ANDREW: I said, leave her alone.  JOHN: You gonna make me?  ANDREW: Yeah.  John walks closer.  JOHN: You and how many of your friends?  ANDREW: Just me. Just you and me. Two hits. Me hitting you, you hitting the floor. Anytime you\'re ready, pal.  John shoves Andrew. Andrew grabs John’s arm and pins him to the ground.  JOHN: I don\'t want to get into this with you, man.  Andrew gets off of him.  ANDREW: Why not?  JOHN: Because I\'d kill you. It\'s real simple: I\'d kill you, and your fucking parents would sue me, and it\'d be a big mess, and I don\'t care enough about you to bother.  He backs up as he talks.  ANDREW: Chickenshit.  Andrew turns away, but looks back when he hears John pull out a switchblade. John stabs it into a chair.  ANDREW: Let\'s end this right now. You don\'t talk to her-  Allison takes John’s knife.  ANDREW: -you don\'t look at her, and you don\'t even think about her! You understand me?  JOHN: I\'m trying to help her.  Cut to Carl the janitor entering. He empties a trash near the kids.  CARL: Hey, Brian, how you doing?  JOHN: Your dad work here?  Andrew smirks.  JOHN: Uh, Carl?  CARL: What?  JOHN: Can I ask you a question?  CARL: Sure.  JOHN: How does one become a janitor?  CARL: You want to be a janitor?  JOHN: No, I just want to know how one becomes a janitor, because Andrew here is very interested in pursuing a career in the custodial arts.  CARL: Oh, really? You guys think I\'m just some untouchable peasant? Serf? Peon? Huh? Maybe so. But following a broom around after shitheads like you for the last eight years, I\'ve learned a couple of things. I look through your letters. I look through your lockers. I listen to your conversations: you don\'t know that but I do. I am the eyes and ears of this institution, my friends.  He turns to leave and checks his watch.  CARL: By the way, that clock\'s 20 minutes fast.  John smiles as Carl leaves. Cut to Vernon in his office. He sees the clock reach 11:30 and gets up. In the detention room, John whistles with a bandana on his head. The rest of the kids join in. They stop when Vernon enters. John switches to a different tune.  VERNON: Alright, girls. That’s thirty minutes for lunch.  ANDREW: Here?  VERNON: Here.  ANDREW: Well, I think the cafeteria would be a more suitable place for us to eat lunch in, sir.  VERNON: Well, I don’t care what you think, Andrew.  JOHN: Uh, Dick- excuse me, Rich. Will milk be made available to us?  ANDREW: We’re extremely thirsty, sir.  CLAIRE: I have a really low tolerance for dehydration.  ANDREW: I’ve seen her dehydrate, sir. It’s pretty gross.  JOHN: Relax, I’ll get it.  John begins to get up.  VERNON: Ah, ah, ah. Grab some wood there, bub. What, do you think I was born yesterday? You think I’m going to have you roaming these halls? You.  He looks at Andrew. Andrew gestures to Claire.  VERNON: And you.  Vernon points to Allison. She doesn’t notice.  VERNON: Hey! What’s her name? Wake her, wake her up. Hey, come on, on your feet, missy. Let’s go. This is no rest home.  Allison grabs her bag and gets up.  VERNON: There’s a soft drink machine in the teacher’s lounge. Let’s go.  Andrew gets up. Cut to Andrew and Allison walking down the halls. Allison keeps a distance a few steps behind him.  ANDREW: So, what’s your poison? What do you drink?  She says nothing.  ANDREW: Okay, forget I asked.  They walk in silence for a moment.  ALLISON: Vodka.  ANDREW: Vodka. When do you drink vodka?  ALLISON: Whenever.  She moves up a step ahead of him.  ANDREW: A lot?  ALLISON: Tons.  ANDREW: Is that why you’re here today? Why are you here?  ALLISON: Why are you here?  He takes a moment and backs up.  ANDREW: Um… I’m here today because, uh… Because my coach and my father don’t want me to blow my ride. See, I get treated differently because, uh, coach thinks I’m a winner. So does my old man. I’m not a winner because I want to be one. I’m a winner because I got strength and speed, kind of like a racehorse. That’s about how involved I am in what’s happening to me.  ALLISON: Yeah. That’s very interesting. Now, why don’t you tell me why you’re really in here.  ANDREW: Forget it.  Back in the detention room, John is watching Claire. She rotates around a statue in the middle of the room. Brian is sitting near John, also watching her.  JOHN: Claire? You want to see a picture of a guy with elephantitis of the nuts? It’s pretty tasty.  CLAIRE: No, thank you.  JOHN: How do you think he rides a bike?  She just glares at him.  JOHN: Oh, Claire, would you ever consider dating a guy like this?  CLAIRE: Can’t you just leave me alone?  JOHN: I mean, if he had a great personality and was a good dancer and had a cool car. Although, you’d probably have to ride in the backseat because his nuts would ride shotgun.  CLAIRE: You know what I wish I was doing?  JOHN: Watch what you say. Brian here is a cherry.  BRIAN: A cherry?  CLAIRE: I wish I was in a plane to France.  BRIAN: I’m not a cherry.  JOHN: When have you ever gotten laid?  BRIAN: I’ve laid lots of times.  JOHN: Name one.  BRIAN: She lives in Canada. Met her at Niagara Falls. You wouldn’t know her.  JOHN: Ever laid anyone around here?  Brian gestures to Claire.  JOHN: Oh, you and Claire did it.  CLAIRE: What are you talking about?  BRIAN: Nothing, nothing. Let’s just drop it, okay? We’ll talk about it later.  CLAIRE: No, drop what? What are you talking about?  JOHN: Well, Brian’s trying to tell me that in addition to the number of girls in the Niagara Falls area, that presently you and he are riding the hobby horse.  CLAIRE: You little pig.  BRIAN: No, I’m not. I’m n- John said I was a cherry and I said I wasn’t. That’s it. That’s all that was said.  JOHN: Well, then what were you motioning to Claire for?  CLAIRE: You know, I don’t appreciate this very much, Brian.  BRIAN: He is lying.  JOHN: Oh, you weren’t motioning to Claire?  BRIAN: You know he’s lying, right?  JOHN: Were you or were you not motioning to Claire?  BRIAN: Yeah, but it was only because I didn’t want her to know I was a virgin, okay? Excuse me for being a virgin, I’m sorry.  CLAIRE: Why didn’t you want me to know you were a virgin?  BRIAN: Because it’s personal business. It’s my personal private business.  JOHN: Well, Brian, it doesn’t sound like you’re doing any business.  CLAIRE: I think it’s okay for a guy to be a virgin.  BRIAN: You do?  Cut to Claire, John, and Andrew sitting at a table. Some drinks are spread out on the table. Claire and Andrew are opening bags of food.  JOHN: What’s in there?  CLAIRE: Guess. Where’s your lunch?  JOHN: You’re wearing it.  CLAIRE: You’re nauseating.  John grabs a drink and tosses it to Allison, who’s looking at an album. Claire takes out her lunch.  JOHN: What’s that?  CLAIRE: Sushi.  JOHN: Sushi?  CLAIRE: Rice, raw fish, and seaweed.  JOHN: You won’t accept a guy’s tongue in your mouth and you’re gonna eat that?  CLAIRE: Can I eat?  JOHN: I don’t know. Give it a try.  Andrew takes out his lunch, which has substantially more food than anyone else’s. Allison opens her drink which fizzes over, and she slurps up what spills. Brian looks at her. Andrew notices Claire and John staring at him.  ANDREW: What’s your problem?  Allison takes apart her sandwich, tossing the meat at the statue in the middle of the room. She pours a large amount of sugar all over her food and begins mashing it all up as the others stare. She notices them as she takes a bite. John moves over to Brian and takes his food.  JOHN: What are we having?  BRIAN: Uh, just your standard regular lunch, I guess.  John reaches in and pulls out a thermos.  JOHN: Milk?  BRIAN: Soup.  John reaches in the bag again. Brian reaches over, but John slaps his hand away. He pulls out a juice box.  BRIAN: That’s apple juice.  JOHN: I can read. PB&J with the crusts cut off. Well, Brian, this is a very nutritious lunch. All the food groups are represented. Did your mom marry Mr. Rogers?  BRIAN: Uh, no. Mr. Johnson.  JOHN: Ah. Here\'s my impression of life at Big Bri\'s house.  He gets up and begins acting out a scene.  JOHN: ""Son?"" ""Yeah, Dad?"" ""How was your day, pal?"" ""Great, Dad! How\'s yours?"" ""Super! Say, son, how’d you like to go fishing this weekend?"" ""Great, Dad! But I got homework to do."" ""That\'s okay, son! You can do it on the boat!"" ""Gee!"" ""Dear, isn\'t our son swell?"" ""Yes, dear. Isn\'t life swell?""  He mimes Brian’s parents kissing each other, then punching one of them. Andrew sees Brian’s face fall.  ANDREW: All right, what about your family?  JOHN: What, mine?  ANDREW: Yeah.  JOHN: It’s real easy.  He gets up and acts out another scene.  JOHN: ""Stupid, worthless, no good, goddamned, free loading son-of-a-bitch! Retarded, big mouth, know-it-all asshole jerk!"" ""You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful!"" ""Shut up, bitch! Go fix me a turkey pot pie!"" ""What about you, Dad?"" ""Fuck you!"" ""No, Dad, what about you?"" ""Fuck you!"" ""No, Dad, what about you?!"" ""Fuck you!""  He mimes getting punched by his dad.  BRIAN: Is that for real?  JOHN: You wanna come over some time?  ANDREW: That\'s bullshit. It\'s all part of your image; I don\'t believe a word of it.  JOHN: You don\'t believe me?  ANDREW: No.  JOHN: No?  ANDREW: Did I stutter?  John walks over to Andrew. He pulls up his sleeve and shows Andrew a burn mark on his arm.  JOHN: Believe this? Huh? It\'s about the size of a cigar. Do I stutter? You see, this is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage. See, I don\'t think that I need to sit with you fuckin\' dildos anymore!  He walks away, swiping some books off of a desk in anger. He climbs up some stairs and takes a moment to breathe.  CLAIRE: You shouldn’t have said that.  ANDREW: How did I know? I mean, he lies about everything anyway.  Cut to Vernon eating lunch in his office. He spills his drink all over his desk.  VERNON: Oh, shit.  He walks out of his office.  VERNON: Coffee. Probably scrape it off the bottom of the Mississippi River. Everything’s polluted. The coffee’s polluted.  As Vernon rounds a corner, the kids exit the detention room. He enters the bathroom while the kids walk the halls.  CLAIRE: How do you know where Vernon went?  JOHN: I don’t.  CLAIRE: Well, then how do you know when he’ll be back?  JOHN: I don’t. Being bad feels pretty good, huh?  BRIAN: What’s the point of going to Bender’s locker?  ANDREW: Beats me.  BRIAN: This is so stupid. Why do you think, why are we risking getting caught?  ANDREW: I don’t know.  BRIAN: So then, what are we doing?  ANDREW: You ask me one more question and I’m beating the shit out of you.  BRIAN: Sorry.  Cut to John’s locker. He opens it.  ANDREW: You’re such a slob.  JOHN: My maid’s on vacation.  He takes out a bag. He pulls another bag out of it, and then a third bag out of the second. Finally, he pulls a bag of weed out. Brian sniffs.  BRIAN: Drugs.  ANDREW: Screw that, Bender. Put it back.  BRIAN: Drugs. The boy has marijuana.  John walks away, then Claire.  BRIAN: That was marijuana.  ANDREW: Shut up, dick.  Andrew follows.  BRIAN: Do you approve of this?  Allison doesn’t respond. Brian turns and follows the others. Allison steals the lock off of John’s locker. Cut to John and Andrew walking in unison.  JOHN: We’ll cross through the lab, and then we’ll double back.  ANDREW: You better be right. If Vernon cuts us off, it’s your fault, asshole.  BRIAN: What’d he say? Where are we going?  As the kids come around a corner, they see Vernon heading back to the detention room. They scramble around various hallways as music plays, often being barely missed by Vernon.  JOHN: Wait, wait, hold it, hold it. We have to go through the cafeteria.  ANDREW: No, the activities hall.  JOHN: Hey, man, you don’t know what you’re talking about.  ANDREW: No, you don’t know what you’re talking about! Now, we’re through listening to you. We’re going this way. You go where you want, mother hen.  Andrew runs off. Brian and Claire follow. Allison looks at John for a moment before they both follow the others. Vernon walks slowly to where the kids just were. They kids find themselves blocked by a gate.  ANDREW: Shit.  JOHN: Great idea, jagoff.  ANDREW: Fuck you!  CLAIRE: Fuck you! Why didn’t you listen to John?  BRIAN: We’re dead.  JOHN: No, just me.  BRIAN: What do you mean?  JOHN: Get back to the library.  He shoves the weed in Brian’s pants.  JOHN: Keep your unit out of it.  John runs down the hallway, yelling.  JOHN: I want to be an air force ranger! I want to lead a life of danger!  Elsewhere, Vernon hears John in the distance.  VERNON: That son of a bitch!  Vernon runs off. We see shots of each of them running through hallways.  JOHN: Before the day I die, there’s some things I want to buy! Light bulbs, light bulbs, automobile, and a Ferris wheel! I want to be an air force ranger! I want to lead a life of danger!  Vernon turns a corner, out of breath. He hears a sound in the distance. Cut to John in the gymnasium, playing with a basketball.  JOHN: Ah! Three, two, one!  He makes a slam dunk. Vernon walks in.  JOHN: Big applause!  VERNON: Bender! What is this? What are you doing here? What is this?  JOHN: Hi.  John dribbles.  VERNON: Out! That’s it, Bender. Out, it’s over.  JOHN: Don’t you want to hear my excuse?  VERNON: Out!  JOHN: I’m thinking of trying out for a scholarship.  VERNON: Give me the ball, Bender. Give me that ball.  John does two fake outs before rolling the ball over gently. Vernon kicks it at him. They both exit the gymnasium. Cut back to the detention room.  VERNON: Get your stuff, let’s go.  Vernon shoves John towards the tables.  VERNON: Mr. Wiseguy here has taken it upon himself to go to the gymnasium. I’m sorry to inform you you’re going to be without his services for the rest of the day.  JOHN: B-O-O-H-O-O.  VERNON: Everything’s a big joke, huh, Bender? The false alarm you pulled Friday, false alarms are really funny, aren’t they? What if your home, what if your family… What if your dope was on fire?  JOHN: Impossible, sir. It’s in Johnson’s underwear.  Andrew chuckles.  VERNON: Oh, you think he’s funny? You think this is cute? You think he’s bitchin’? Is that it? Let me tell you something. Look at him. He’s a bum. You wanna see something funny? You go visit John Bender in five years, you’ll see how goddamn funny he is.  Vernon walks over to John.  VERNON: What’s the matter, John? You gonna cry? Let’s go.  Vernon grabs John’s arm. John gets up and shakes him off.  JOHN: Hey, keep your fucking hands off me! I expect better manners from you, Dick.  John walks away. He sets sunglasses down in front of Andrew.  JOHN: For better hallway vision.  John knocks things off of a desk as he leaves, followed by Vernon. Cut to the two of them in a closet.  VERNON: That’s the last time, Bender. That’s the last time you ever make me look bad in front of those kids, do you hear me? I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year and I’ve got a home, and I’m not about to throw it away on some punk like you. But someday, man, someday when you’re out of here and you’ve forgotten all about this place, and they’ve forgotten all about you, and you’re wrapped up in your own pathetic life, I’m gonna be there. That’s right. And I’m gonna kick the living shit out of you, man. I’m going to knock your dick in the dirt.  JOHN: You threatening me?  VERNON: What’re you gonna do about it? You think anybody’s gonna believe you? You think anybody is gonna take your word over mine? I’m a man of respect around here. They love me around here. I’m a swell guy. You’re a lying sack of shit and everybody knows it. Oh, you’re a tough guy. Hey, hey, come on, come on. Get on your feet, pal. Let’s find out how tough you are. I wanna know right now how tough you are. Come on, I’ll give you the first punch. Let’s go, come on. Right here. Just take the first shot. Please, I’m begging you. Take a shot right here, come on. Just take one shot. That’s all I need. Just one swing.  John doesn’t do anything. Vernon backs off. He goes for a fake out and John flinches.  VERNON: That’s what I thought. You’re a gutless turd.  Vernon exits, locking the door on his way out. Cut to him entering the bathroom, then back to the closet. The camera pans up a stack of objects and then to a roof tile sliding into place. Cut to John making his way above the ceiling, crawling on all fours.  JOHN: A naked blonde walks into a bar with a poodle under one arm and a two-foot salami under the other. She lays the poodle on the table. Bartender says, ""I suppose you won\'t be needing a drink."" Naked lady says- Oh, shit!  He falls through the ceiling into the detention room.  VERNON: Jesus Christ Almighty!  The other kids look on in shock as John falls and then makes his way down the stairs to the main table area.  JOHN: Forgot my pencil.  He walks over to his seat.  VERNON: Goddamn it!  Vernon enters. John is nowhere to be seen.  VERNON: What in god\'s name is goin\' on in here? What was that ruckus?  The kids just shrug.  ANDREW: Uh, what ruckus?  VERNON: I was just in my office and I heard a ruckus.  BRIAN: Could you describe the ruckus, sir?  VERNON: Watch your tongue, young man, watch it.  Under the table in front of Claire, John hits his head. Andrew hits along in a rhythm.  VERNON: What is this?  Andrew makes a zipper sound.  VERNON: What is that? What, what is that, what is that noise?  Under the table, John stares at Claire’s panties.  ANDREW: What noise?  CLAIRE: Really, sir, there wasn\'t any noise.  As John moves closer, she crushes his head between her knees. He cries out. Claire pretends to sneeze to cover. The other students cough along.  CLAIRE: That noise? Was that the noise that you\'re talking about?  VERNON: No, it wasn\'t. That was not the noise I was talking about. Now, I may not have caught you in the act this time, but you can bet I will.  Allison laughs.  VERNON: You make book on that, Missy. And you!  He points to Claire.  VERNON: I will not be made a fool of.  Vernon walks away. Toilet paper liner is stuck to the back of his pants. As the door slams shut, Andrew, Brian, and Allison crack up. Claire kicks John and scoots her chair back. She keeps hitting him as he gets out from under the table  JOHN: It was an accident.  CLAIRE: You’re an asshole.  JOHN: Sue me.  He walks over to Brian.  JOHN: So, Ahab, can I have all my doobage?  Brian pulls out the weed and hands it to John.  ANDREW: Yo, wasteoid. You’re not going to blaze up in here.  John ignores him. Claire looks at Andrew, who shakes his head. She gets up and follows John anyway. Brian awkwardly clears his throat. He mouths a question and Andrew, who shakes his head. Biran looks around for a moment and then walks to the back. Andrew turns away and looks agitated.  ANDREW: Shit.  He grabs his sunglasses and gets up. Allison watches. Cut to Vernon, who enters the basement. Cut back to the detention room. Brian is wearing the sunglasses. He, John, and Claire giggle. John lights a match with his teeth and lights the blunt in Claire’s mouth. She coughs. John laughs. Brian pretends to eat the smoke from his blunt. Brian begins doing an impression.  BRIAN: Chicks cannot hold their smoke. That’s what it is.  John chuckles  CLAIRE: Do you know how popular I am? I’m so popular, everybody loves me so much at this school.  BRIAN: Poor baby.  Allison stares slack-jawed at the others from her table.  BRIAN: Five.  He holds up his hand. John gives him a forceful high-five, pushing him backwards. His legs go up in the air. Claire laughs. Andrew exits a nearby smoke-filled room smoking a blunt. He takes off his jacket and starts dancing around.  ANDREW: Woo!  He does a cart-wheel as he goes, then a barrel-roll. He takes off his shirt and swings it around, throwing it down. Brian whistles. Andrew pretends to hit himself and then keeps running around the perimeter of the second floor. Brian, laughing, hits Claire, who yelps. Andrew makes his way back to the smoke-filled room and walks in closing the door. He yells, and the glass on the door’s window shatters. Cut to Vernon, who’s reading files.  VERNON: Mr… Oh, Mr. Tierney. A history of slight mental illness.  Carl walks in.  VERNON: No wonder he’s so fucked up.  CARL: Afternoon, Dick.  Vernon looks up and puts the file he’s reading down.  VERNON: Hey, Carl, how you doing?  CARL: Good.  VERNON: Good, what’s up?  CARL: Not much. What’s happening? What are you doing in the basement files?  VERNON: Oh, nothing, nothing here. I’m just doing a little homework here.  CARL: Homework, huh?  Carl walks closer.  VERNON: Yeah.  CARL: Confidential files, huh?  VERNON: Well, look, Carl, this is a highly sensitive area, and I, I tell you something, certain people would be very, very embarrassed. I would really appreciate it if this would be something that you and I could keep between us.  CARL: What are you gonna do for me, man?  VERNON: What would you like?  CARL: You got fifty bucks?  VERNON: What?  CARL: Fifty bucks.  Cut back to the detention room. Brian and Andrew are sitting in chairs and laughing.  ANDREW: No, no, man, no. You got a middle name?  BRIAN: Yeah, guess.  ANDREW: Uh-  Allison begins walking over.  ALLISON: Your middle name is Ralph, as in, puke. Your birth date’s March 12th, you’re five-nine and a half, you weigh 130 pounds and your social security number is 049-38-0913.  She sits near Brian.  ANDREW: Wow, are you psychic?  ALLISON: No.  BRIAN: Well, would you mind telling me how you know all this about me?  She pulls out a wallet from her bag.  ALLISON: I stole your wallet.  BRIAN: Give it to me.  ALLISON: No.  BRIAN: Give it.  She tosses it down.  BRIAN: This is great, you’re a thief too, huh?  ALLISON: I’m not a thief.  ANDREW: Multi-talented.  ALLISON: What’s there to steal? Two bucks and a beaver shot.  ANDREW: A what?  ALLISON: He’s got a nudie picture in there. I saw it. It’s perverted.  ANDREW: Alright, let’s see it.  John brushes his teeth. Claire reads a clip of IDs.  CLAIRE: Are all these your girlfriends?  JOHN: Some of them.  CLAIRE: What about the others?  JOHN: Well, some I consider my girlfriends and some I just consider.  CLAIRE: Consider what?  JOHN: Whether or not I want to hang out with them.  CLAIRE: You don’t believe in just one guy, one girl?  JOHN: Do you?  CLAIRE: Yeah. That’s the way it should be.  JOHN: Not for me.  CLAIRE: Why not?  JOHN: How come you got so much shit in your purse?  CLAIRE: How come you have so many girlfriends?  JOHN: I asked you first.  CLAIRE: I don’t know. I guess I never throw anything away.  JOHN: Neither do I.  CLAIRE: Oh.  ANDREW: This is the worst fake ID I’ve ever seen. You realize you made yourself 68?  BRIAN: Oh, I know, I know, I goofed it.  ANDREW: What do you need a fake ID for?  BRIAN: So I can vote.  ALLISON: Want to see what’s in my bag?  ANDREW AND BRIAN: No.  She looks at them, then spills the contents of her bag all over the couch.  ANDREW: Holy shit. What is all that stuff?  BRIAN: Do you always carry this much shit in your bag?  ALLISON: Yeah. I always carry this much shit in my bag. You never know when you may have to jam.  BRIAN: Are you going to be like, a shopping bag lady? You know, like, sit in alleyways, and, like, talk to buildings and wear men’s shoes and that kind of thing?  ALLISON: I’ll do what I have to do.  BRIAN: Why do you have to do anything?  ALLISON: My home life is unsatisfying.  BRIAN: So you’re saying you’d subject yourself to the violent dangers of these Chicago streets because your home life is unsatisfying?  ALLISON: I don’t have to run away and live in the street. I can run away and I can go to the ocean. I can go to the country. I can go to the mountains. I can go to Israel, Africa, Afghanistan.  Brian leans over to Andrew.  BRIAN: Andy, you want to get in on this? Allison here says she wants to run away because her home life is unsatisfying.  ANDREW: Well, everyone’s home life is unsatisfying. And if it wasn’t, people would live with their parents forever.  BRIAN: Yeah, yeah. I understand, but I think hers goes beyond what, you know, guys like you and me consider normal unsatisfying.  ALLISON: Never mind, forget it, everything’s cool.  She begins packing stuff back in her bag.  ANDREW: What’s the deal?  ALLISON: No. There’s no deal, sporto. Forget it. Leave me alone.  ANDREW: Wait a minute. Now, you’re carrying all that crap around in your purse. Either you really want to run away or you want people to think you want to run away.  ALLISON: Eat shit.  She walks off.  BRIAN: The girl is an island with herself.  Andrew throws Brian’s wallet back at Brian and walks off towards Allison.  ANDREW: Hi. You want to talk?  ALLISON: No.  ANDREW: Why not?  ALLISON: Go away.  ANDREW: Where do you want me to go?  ALLISON: Go away!  After a few moments, he walks away.  ALLISON: You have problems.  ANDREW: Oh, I have problems?  ALLISON: You do everything everybody ever tells you to do! That is a problem.  ANDREW: Okay, fine. But I didn’t dump my purse out on the couch and invite people into my problems, did I?  He walks closer to her.  ANDREW: So what’s wrong? What is it? Is it bad? Real bad? Parents?  ALLISON: Yeah.  ANDREW: What did they do to you?  ALLISON: They ignore me.  ANDREW: Yeah. Yeah.  Cut to Vernon and Carl.  VERNON: What did you want to be when you were young?  CARL: When I was a kid I wanted to be John Lennon.  VERNON: Carl, don’t be a goof. I’m trying to make a serious point here. Carl, I’ve been teaching for twenty two years, and each year these kids get more and more arrogant.  CARL: Oh, bullshit, man. Come on, Vern. The kids haven’t changed, you have. You took a teaching position because you thought it’d be fun, right? Thought you could have summer vacations off? And then you found out it was actually work. That really bummed you out.  Vernon shakes his head.  VERNON: These kids turned on me. They think I’m a big fucking joke.  CARL: Come on. Listen, Vern, if you were sixteen, what would you think of you?  VERNON: Hey, Carl, you think I give one rat’s ass what these kids think of me?  CARL: Yes, I do.  VERNON: You think about this. When you get old, these kids, when I get old, they’re gonna be running the country.  CARL: Yeah.  VERNON: Now, this is the thought that wakes me up in the middle of the night, that when I get older, these kids are gonna take care of me.  CARL: I wouldn\'t count on it.  Back in the detention room, all five kids are seated on the floor.  ANDREW: What would I do for a million bucks? I guess I’d do as little as I had to.  CLAIRE: That’s boring.  ANDREW: Well, how am I supposed to answer?  CLAIRE: The idea is to, like, search your mind for the absolute limit. Like, um… Would you drive to school naked?  He laughs.  ANDREW: Uh, would I have to get out of the car?  CLAIRE: Of course.  ANDREW: In the spring? Or winter?  CLAIRE: Doesn’t matter. Spring.  ANDREW: In front of the school or in back of the school?  CLAIRE: Either one.  ANDREW: Yes.  ALLISON: I’d do that. I’ll do anything sexual. I don’t need a million dollars to do it, either.  CLAIRE: You’re lying.  ALLISON: I already have. I’ve done just about everything there is except a few things that are illegal. I’m a nymphomaniac.  CLAIRE: Lie.  BRIAN: Are your parents aware of this?  ALLISON: The only person I told was my shrink.  ANDREW: What did he do when you told him?  ALLISON: He nailed me.  CLAIRE: Very nice.  ALLISON: I don’t think that from a legal standpoint what he did can be construed as rape since I paid him.  CLAIRE: He’s an adult.  ALLISON: Yeah, he’s married, too.  CLAIRE: Ugh. Do you have any idea how completely gross that is?  ALLISON: Well, the first few times-  CLAIRE: The first few times? You mean he did it more than once?  ALLISON: Sure.  CLAIRE: Are you crazy?  BRIAN: Obviously she’s crazy if she’s screwing a shrink.  ALLISON: Have you ever done it?  CLAIRE: I don’t even have a psychiatrist.  ALLISON: Have you ever done it with a normal person?  CLAIRE: Didn\'t we already cover this?  JOHN: You never answered the question.  CLAIRE: Look, I\'m not going to discuss my private life with total strangers.  ALLISON: It\'s kind of a double edged sword, isn\'t it?  CLAIRE: A what?  ALLISON: Well, if you say you haven\'t, you\'re a prude. If you say you have, you\'re a slut. It\'s a trap. You want to but you can\'t, and when you do, you wish you didn\'t, right?  CLAIRE: Wrong.  ALLISON: Or are you a tease?  ANDREW: She\'s a tease.  CLAIRE: I\'m sure. Why don\'t you just forget it.  ANDREW: Oh, you\'re a tease and you know it. All girls are teases.  JOHN: She\'s only a tease if what she does gets you hot.  CLAIRE: I don\'t do anything.  ALLISON: That\'s why you\'re a tease.  CLAIRE: Okay, let me ask you a few questions.  ALLISON: I already told you everything.  CLAIRE: No. Doesn\'t it bother you to sleep around without being in love? I mean, don\'t you want any respect?  ALLISON: I don\'t screw to get respect. That\'s the difference between you and me.  CLAIRE: It\'s not the only difference I hope.  JOHN: Face it, you\'re a tease.  CLAIRE: I\'m not a tease.  JOHN: Sure you are. Sex is your weapon. You said it yourself. You use it to get respect.  CLAIRE: No, I never said that. She twisted my words around.  JOHN: What do you use it for then?  CLAIRE: I don\'t use it period.  JOHN: Oh, are you medically frigid or is it psychological?  CLAIRE: I didn\'t mean it that way. You guys are putting words into my mouth.  JOHN: Well, if you\'d just answer the question.  BRIAN: Why don\'t you just answer the question?  ANDREW: Be honest.  JOHN: No big deal.  BRIAN: Yeah answer it.  ANDREW: Answer the question, Claire.  JOHN: Talk to us.  They all begin talking over each other, prodding her to answer the question.  JOHN: C\'mon, it\'s easy. It\'s only one question.  CLAIRE: No, I never did it!  ALLISON: I never did it either. I\'m not a nymphomaniac, I\'m a compulsive liar.  CLAIRE: You are such a bitch. You did that on purpose just to fuck me over.  ALLISON: I would do it, though. If you love someone, it’s okay.  CLAIRE: I can’t believe you. You’re so weird. You don’t say anything all day and then when you open your mouth you unload all these tremendous lies all over me.  ANDREW: You’re just pissed off because she got you to admit something you didn’t want to admit to.  CLAIRE: Okay, fine. But that doesn’t make it any less bizarre.  ANDREW: What\'s bizarre? I mean, we\'re all pretty bizarre! Some of us are just better at hiding it, that\'s all.  CLAIRE: How are you bizarre?  ALLISON: He can\'t think for himself.  ANDREW: She\'s right. Do you guys know what uh, what I did to get in here?  Claire shakes her head.  ANDREW: I taped Larry Lester\'s buns together.  BRIAN: That was you?  ANDREW: Yeah, you know him?  BRIAN: Yeah, I know him.  ANDREW: Well then, you know how hairy he is right? Well, when they pulled the tape off, most of his hair came off and some, some skin too.  CLAIRE: Oh, my god.  ANDREW: And the bizarre thing is, is that I did it for my old man. I tortured this poor kid, because I wanted him to think that I was cool. He\'s always going off about, you know, when he was in school, all the wild things he used to do. And I got the feeling that he was disappointed that I never cut loose on anyone, right? So, I\'m, I\'m sitting in the locker room, and I\'m taping up my knee, and Larry\'s undressing a couple lockers down from me. And he\'s kinda, he\'s kinda skinny, weak. And I started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. And the next thing I knew, I, uh, I jumped on top of him and started wailing on him. And my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. And, afterwards, when I was sitting in Vernon\'s office, all I could think about was Larry\'s father. And Larry havin\' to go home and, and explain what happened to him. And the humiliation, fucking humiliation he must\'ve felt. It must\'ve been unreal. I mean, I mean, how do you apologize for something like that? There\'s no way. It\'s all because of me and my old man. God, I fucking hate him! He\'s like this, he\'s like this mindless machine that I can\'t even relate to anymore. ""Andrew, you\'ve got to be number one! I won\'t tolerate any losers in this family. Your intensity is for shit! Win! Win! Win!"" You son of a bitch. You know, sometimes, I wish my knee would give, and I wouldn\'t be able to wrestle anymore. And he could forget all about me.  JOHN: I think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling.  BRIAN: It\'s like me, you know, with my grades. Like, when I, when I step outside myself kinda, and when I, when I look in at myself you know? And I see me. I don\'t like what I see. I really don\'t.  CLAIRE: What\'s wrong with you? Why don\'t you like yourself?  BRIAN: Sounds stupid, but… ‘Cause I\'m failing shop. See, we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um, and we had eight weeks to do it and we\'re supposed to, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk, the light was supposed to go on. My light didn\'t go on. I got an F on it. Never got an F in my life. When I signed up, you know, for the course, I mean, I thought I was playing it real smart, you know. \'Cause I thought, ""I\'ll take shop, it\'ll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average.""  JOHN: Why\'d you think it\'d be easy?  BRIAN: Have you seen some of the dopes that take shop?  JOHN: I take shop. You must be a fuckin\' idiot.  BRIAN: I\'m a fuckin\' idiot because I can\'t make a lamp?  JOHN: No, you\'re a genius because you can\'t make a lamp.  BRIAN: What do you know about Trigonometry?  JOHN: I could care less about Trigonometry.  BRIAN: Bender, did you know without Trigonometry, there\'d be no engineering?  JOHN: Without lamps, there\'d be no light.  CLAIRE: Okay, so neither one of you is any better than the other one.  ALLISON: I can write with my toes. I can also eat, brush my teeth.  CLAIRE: With your feet?  ALLISON: Play Heart and Soul on the piano.  BRIAN: I can make spaghetti.  CLAIRE: What can you do?  ANDREW: I can tape all of your buns together.  JOHN: I want to see what Claire can do.  CLAIRE: I can’t do anything.  JOHN: No, everybody can do something.  CLAIRE: There’s one thing I can do… No, forget it. It’s way too embarrassing.  JOHN: You ever see “Wild Kingdom?” I mean, that guy’s been doing that show for thirty years.  CLAIRE: Okay. You have to swear to God you won’t laugh.  John motions a cross.  CLAIRE: Okay. I can’t believe I’m actually doing this.  She sticks a tube of lipstick between her breasts. She leans her head down and swings it either way. When she brings her head up, she’s successfully applied lipstick to her lips. The other kids clap.  ANDREW: Alright. Great. Where’d you learn to do that?  CLAIRE: Camp, seventh grade.  John keeps clapping.  JOHN: That was great, Claire.  She wipes the lipstick off.  JOHN: My image of you is totally blown.  ALLISON: You’re a shit. Don’t do that to her. You swore to God you wouldn’t laugh.  JOHN: Am I laughing?  ANDREW: You fucking prick.  JOHN: What do you care what I think anyway? I don’t even count, right? I could disappear forever and it wouldn’t make any difference. I may as well not even exist at this school, remember? And you don’t like me anyway.  CLAIRE: You know, I have just as many feelings as you do, and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them.  JOHN: God, you’re so pathetic. Don’t you ever, ever compare yourself to me, okay? You got everything and I got shit. Fucking Rapunzel, right? School would probably fucking shut down if you didn’t show up. Queenie isn’t here. I like those earrings, Claire.  CLAIRE: Shut up.  JOHN: Are those real diamonds, Claire?  CLAIRE: Shut up.  JOHN: I bet they are. Did you work for the money for those earrings?  CLAIRE: Shut your mouth.  JOHN: Or did your daddy buy those?  CLAIRE: Shut up!  JOHN: I bet he bought those for you. I bet those were a Christmas gift, right? You know what I got for Christmas this year? It was a banner fucking year at the old Bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me and said, “Hey, smoke up, Johnny.” Okay? So go home and cry to your daddy. Don’t cry here, okay?  ANDREW: My God, are we gonna be like our parents?  CLAIRE: Not me. Ever.  ALLISON: It\'s unavoidable, it just happens.  CLAIRE: What happens?  ALLISON: When you grow up, your heart dies.  JOHN: Who cares?  ALLISON: I care.  BRIAN: I was thinking, I mean... I know it’s kind of a weird time, but I was just wondering, um… What is going to happen to us on Monday when we’re all together again? I mean, I consider you guys my friends. I’m not wrong, am I?  ANDREW: No.  BRIAN: So on Monday, what happens?  CLAIRE: Are we still friends, you mean? If we’re friends now, that is.  BRIAN: Yeah.  CLAIRE: Do you want the truth?  BRIAN: Yeah, I want the truth.  CLAIRE: I don’t think so.  ALLISON: With all of us? Or just John.  CLAIRE: With all of you.  ANDREW: That’s a real nice attitude, Claire.  CLAIRE: Oh, be honest, Andy. If Brian came walking up to you in the hall on Monday, what would you do? I mean, picture this. You’re there with all the sports. I know exactly what you’d do. You’d say hi to him, and when he left, you’d cut him all up so your friends wouldn’t think that you really liked him.  ANDREW: No way.  ALLISON: What if I came up to you?  CLAIRE: Same exact thing.  JOHN: You are a bitch.  CLAIRE: Why, ‘cause I’m telling the truth? That makes me a bitch?  JOHN: No, ‘cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone, and you don’t got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell them that you’re going to like who you want to like.  CLAIRE: Okay, what about you, you hypocrite? Why don’t you take Allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties?  Allison chuckles.  CLAIRE: Or take Brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high, or what about Andy for that matter? What about me? What would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together? They’d laugh their asses off. And you’d probably tell them that you were doing it with me so they’d forgive you for being seen with me.  JOHN: Don’t you ever talk about my friends. You don’t know any of my friends, you don’t look at any of my friends, and you certainly wouldn’t condescend to speak to any of my friends. So you just stick to the things that you know. Shopping, nail bolish, your father’s BMW, and your poor, rich, drunk mother in the Caribbean.  CLAIRE: Shut up!  JOHN: And as far as being concerned about what’s going to happen when you and I walk down the hallways at school, you can forget it, because it’s never going to happen. Just bury your head in the sand and wait for your fucking prom.  CLAIRE: I hate you.  JOHN: Yeah? Good.  BRIAN: Okay, then I assume Allison and I are better people than you guys, huh? Us weirdos. Would you… Would you do that to me?  ALLISON: I don’t have any friends.  BRIAN: Well, if you did.  ALLISON: No. I don’t think the kind of friends I’d have would mind.  BRIAN: I just wanna tell each of you that I wouldn\'t do that. I wouldn\'t and I will not! \'Cause I think that\'s real shitty.  CLAIRE: Your friends wouldn\'t mind because they look up to us.  BRIAN: You\'re so conceited, Claire. You\'re so conceited. You\'re so, like, full of yourself. Why are you like that?  CLAIRE: I\'m not saying that to be conceited! I hate it! I hate having to go along with everything my friends say!  BRIAN: Well, then why do you do it?  CLAIRE: I don\'t know, I don\'t... You don\'t understand, you don\'t... You\'re not friends with the same kind of people that Andy and I are friends with. You know, you just don\'t understand the pressure that they can put on you.  BRIAN: I don\'t understand what? You think I don\'t understand pressure, Claire? Well, fuck you! Fuck you!  Brian begins to cry into his sleeve.  BRIAN: Know why I\'m here today? Do you? I\'m here because Mr. Ryan found a gun in my locker.  ANDREW: Why\'d you have a gun in your locker?  BRIAN: I tried. You pull the fuckin\' trunk on it and the light\'s s\'posed to go on, and it didn\'t go on, I mean...  ANDREW: What\'s the gun for, Brian?  BRIAN: Just forget it.  ANDREW: You brought it up, man!  BRIAN: I can\'t have an F. I can\'t have it, and I know my parents can\'t have it. Even if I aced the rest of the semester, I\'m still only a B. And everything\'s ruined for me.  CLAIRE: Brian…  He punches a chair nearby.  BRIAN: So I considered my options, you know?  CLAIRE: No, killing yourself is not an option.  BRIAN: Well I didn\'t do it, did I? No, I don\'t think so!  ALLISON: It was a handgun?  BRIAN: No, it was a flare gun. Went off in my locker.  ANDREW: Really?  Andrew begins to laugh.  BRIAN: It\'s not funny.  Andrew tries to stop himself but can’t contain his laughter. Allison and John try to hide their smiles. Brian starts to laugh after a moment as well.  BRIAN: Yes it is. Fuckin\' elephant was destroyed!  ALLISON: You wanna know what I did to get in here? Nothing. I didn\'t have anything better to do.  Everyone begins to laugh.  ALLISON: You\'re laughing at me!  ANDREW: No!  ALLISON: Yeah, you are!  The laughter continues. Cut to Brian playing music on the radio in an office. Allison dances around the middle of the room. The camera follows her and we see John in the background shaking the statue while on top of it. Brian dances in the office. He throws some papers. Claire dances on the stairs. Andrew sits on a railing, drumming on his knee. A montage plays of the kids dancing in various ways and combinations. The montage ends and John makes his way back across the ceiling to the room he was locked in. the other four kids sit on a railing.  CLAIRE: Brian?  BRIAN: Hm?  CLAIRE: Are you going to write your paper?  BRIAN: Yeah, why?  CLAIRE: Well, it’s kind of a waste for all of us to write our paper, don’t you think?  BRIAN: Well, that’s what Vernon wants us to do.  CLAIRE: True, but I think we’d all kind of say the same thing.  BRIAN: You just don’t want to write your paper, right?  CLAIRE: True, but you’re the smartest, right?  BRIAN: Well, um.  CLAIRE: We trust you.  ANDREW: Yeah.  BRIAN: Alright. I’ll do it.  CLAIRE: Great.  Claire begins to stare at Allison. Allison stares back in response.  CLAIRE: Come on.  ALLISON: Where are we going?  CLAIRE Come on.  Claire gets up. Cut to a close up of Allison’s face as Claire does her makeup.  CLAIRE: Don’t be afraid.  ALLISON: Don’t stick that in my eye.  CLAIRE: I’m not sticking it, just close that- no, wait. Just go like that.  Claire makes a face. Allison copies it. Claire continues.  CLAIRE: Good. You know, you really do look a lot better without all that black shit on your eyes.  ALLISON: Hey, I like that black shit.  CLAIRE: This looks a lot better. Look up.  Brian sits at his desk, working on the paper. Andrew sits on a railing nearby. Claire continues with the makeup.  ALLISON: Please. Why are you being so nice to me?  CLAIRE: Cause you’re letting me.  Brian writes something down. John sits in the closet and looks up as the door opens. Claire enters.  JOHN: You lost?  Brian continues writing. Andrew looks up as Allison enters. She walks over. Andrew hops down from the railing. Brian looks up at her.  ALLISON: Thank you.  Back in the closet, Claire kisses John’s neck.  JOHN: Why’d you do that?  CLAIRE: ‘Cause I knew you wouldn’t.  JOHN: You know how you said before how your parents use you to get back at each other? Wouldn’t I be outstanding in that capacity?  CLAIRE: Were you really disgusted about what I did with my lipstick?  JOHN: Truth?  CLAIRE: Truth.  He nods.  JOHN: No.  Back in the detention room, Brian takes one last look at the paper and kisses it.  ANDREW: What happened to you?  ALLISON: Why? Claire did it.  He doesn’t say anything.  ALLISON: What’s wrong?  ANDREW: Nothing’s wrong. It’s just, you’re so different. I can see your face.  ALLISON: Is that good or bad?  ANDREW: It’s good.  She smiles. Brian gives himself a pat on the arm. Cut to the five of them walking through the hallway. They pass Carl on the way out.  CARL: See you Brian.  BRIAN: Hey, Carl.  JOHN: See you next Saturday.  CARL: You bet.  Cut to them exiting the building. Brian approaches his dad in the car. Andrew and Allison kiss. She rips a patch off of his jersey and walks to her car. Andrew’s dad pulls up. Andrew gets in the car. Claire gives John one of her earrings. He kisses her. She gets in the car and drives away. John puts on the earring she gave him. Cut to Vernon in the detention room reading Brian’s essay.  BRIAN: Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. But we think you\'re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us: In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions.  As the letter continues, John walks across a football field.  BRIAN: But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain...  ANDREW: ...and an athlete...  ALLISON: ...and a basket case...

But the preface is also important as an account by Marx himself of the formative period of Marxism. As such it forms an ap\xadpropriate introduction to the writings of 1837-1846 gathered here in Part I. The ""criticism of post-Hegelian philosophy"" which he mentions in the third-to-last paragraph is a reference to his work. The German Ideology, written jointly with Engels.  * * * I am omitting a general introduction which I had jotted down because on closer reflection any anticipation of results still to be proved appears to me to be disturbing, and the reader who on the whole desires to follow me must be resolved to ascend from the particular to the general. A few indications concerning the course of my own politico-economic studies may, on the other hand, appear in place here. I was taking up law, which discipline, however, I only pursued as a subordinate subject along with philosophy and history. In the year 1842-44, as editor of the Rheinische Zeitung1, I experienced for the first time the embarrassment of having to take part in discussions on so-called material interests. The proceedings of the Rhenish Landtag on thefts of wood and parcelling of landed property, the official polemic which Herr von Schaper, then Oberprasident of the Rhine Province, opened against the Rheinische Zeitung on the conditions of the Moselle peasantry, and finally debates on free trade and protective tariffs provided the first occasions \'for occupying myself with economic questions. On the other hand, at that time when the good will "" to go further"" greatly outweighed knowledge of the subject, a philosophically weakly tinged echo of French socialism and communism made itself audible in the Rheinische Zeitung. I declared myself against this amateurism, but frankly confessed at the same time in a controversy with the  Allgemeine Augsburger Zeitung2 that my previous studies did not permit me even to venture any judgement on the content of the French tendencies. Instead, I eagerly seized on the illusion of the managers of the Rheinische Zeitung, who thought that by a weaker attitude on the part of the paper they could secure a remission of the death sentence passed upon it, to withdraw from the public stage into the study.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The first work which I undertook for a solution of the doubts which assailed me was a critical review of the Hegelian philosophy of right, a work the introduction to which appeared in 1844 in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher3 published in Paris. My investigation led to the result that legal relations as well as forms of state are to be grasped neither from themselves nor from the so-called general development of the human mind, but rather have their roots in the material conditions of life, the sum total of which Hegel, following the example of the Englishmen and Frenchmen of the eighteenth century, combines under the name of ""civil society,"" that, however, the anatomy of civil society is to be sought in political economy. The investigation of the latter, which I began in Paris, I continued in Brussels, whither I had emigrated in consequence of an expulsion order of M. Guizot. The general result at which I arrived and which, once won, served as a guiding thread for my studies, can be briefly formulated as follows: In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces. The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or-what is but a legal expression for the same thing-with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution with the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophic-in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so can we not judge of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production. No social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed; and new, higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself. Therefore mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; since, looking at the matter more closely, it will always be found that the task itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation. In broad outlines Asiatic, ancient, feudal, and modem bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society. The bourgeois relations of production ar,e the last antagonistic form of the social process of production-antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism, but of one arising from the social conditions of life of the individuals; at the same time the productive forces developing in the womb of bourgeois society create the material conditions for the solution of that antagonism. This social formation brings, therefore, the prehistory of human society to a close.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Frederick Engels, with whom, since the appearance of his brilliant sketch on the criticism of the economic categories ( in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher), I maintained a constant exchange of ideas by correspondence, had by another road (compare his The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844) arrived at the same result as I, and when in the spring of 1845 he also settled in Brussels, we resolved to work out in common the opposition of our view to the ideological view of German philosophy, in fact, to settle accounts with our erstwhile philosophical conscience. The resolve was carried out in the form of a criticism of post-Hegelian philosophy. The manuscript, two large octavo volumes, had long reached its place of publication in Westphalia when we received the news that altered circumstances did not allow of its being printed. We abandoned the manuscript to the gnawing criticism of the mice all the more willingly as we had achieved our main purpose-self-clarification. Of the scattered works in which we put our views before the public at that time, now from one aspect, now from another, I will mention only the Manifesto of the Communist Party, jointly written by Engels and myself, and Discours sur le libre échange published by me. The decisive points of our view were first scientifically, although only polemically, indicated in my work published in 1847 and directed against Proudhon : Misere de la Philosophie, etc. A dissertation written in German on Wage Labour, in which I put together my lectures on this subject delivered in the Brussels German Workers\' Society, was interrupted, while being printed, by the February Revolution and my consequent forcible removal from Belgium.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The editing of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in 1848 and 1849, and the subsequent events, interrupted my economic studies which could only be resumed in the year 1850 in London. The enormous material for the history of political economy which is accumulated in the British Museum, the favourable vantage point afforded by London for the observation of bourgeois society, and finally the new stage of development upon which the latter appeared to have entered with the discovery of gold in California and Australia, determined me to begin afresh from the very beginning and to work through the new material critically. These studies led partly of themselves into apparently quite remote subjects on which I had to dwell for a shorter or longer period. Especially, however, was the time at my disposal curtailed by the imperative necessity of earning my living. My contributions, during eight years now, to the first English-American newspaper, the New York Tribune, compelled an extraordinary scattering of my studies, since I occupy myself with newspaper correspondence proper only in exceptional cases. However, articles on striking economic events in England and on the Continent constituted so considerable a part of my contributions that I was compelled to make myself familiar with practical details which lie outside the sphere of the actual science of political economy.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This sketch of the course of my studies in the sphere of political economy is intended only to show that my views, however they may be judged and however little they coincide with the interested prejudices of the ruling classes, are the results of conscientious investigation lasting many years. But at the entrance to science, as at the entrance to hell, the demand must be posted:  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 Qui si convien lasciare ogni sospetto;  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 Ogni vilta convien che qui sia morta.4  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Discovering Hegel  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0KARL MARX  \xa0\xa0\xa0On November 10, 1837, soon after becoming a student at the University of Berlin, Marx wrote a long letter to his father. It shows that at nineteen he had formed two relationships of great importance: a personal one with Jenny von Westphalen of Trier and an intellectual one with the late philosopher Hegel. The love of Jenny led to marriage, the spell of Hegel to Marxism.  Dear Father,  \xa0\xa0\xa0There are moments in one\'s life which are like frontier posts marking the completion of a period but at the same time clearly indicating a new direction. * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0After my arrival in Berlin, I broke off all hitherto existing connections, made visits rarely and unwillingly, and tried to immerse myself in science and art.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In accordance with my state of mind at the time, lyrical poetry was bound to be my first subject, at l east the most pleasant and immediate one. But owing to my attitude and whole previous development it was purely idealistic. My heaven, my art, became a world beyond, as remote as my love. Everything real became hazy and what is hazy has no definite outlines . All the poems of the first three volumes I sent to Jenny are marked by attacks on our times, diffuse and inchoate expressions of feeling, nothing natural, everything built out of moonshine, complete opposition between what is and what ought to be, rhetorical reflections instead of poetic thoughts, but perhaps also a certain warmth of feeling and striving for poetic fire. * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0Poetry, however, could be and had to be only an accompaniment; I had to study law and above all felt the urge to wrestle with philosophy. * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0From the idealism which, by the way, I had compared and nourished with the idealism of Kant and Fichte, I arrived at the point of seeking the idea in reality itself. If previously the gods had dwelt above the earth, now they became its centre.  \xa0\xa0\xa0I had read fragments of Hegel\'s philosophy, the grotesque craggy melody of which did not appeal to me. Once more I wanted to dive into the sea, but with the definite intention of establishing that the nature of the mind is just as necessary, concrete and firmly based as the nature of the body . My aim was no longer to practise tricks of swordsmanship, but to bring genuine pearls into the light of day.  \xa0\xa0\xa0I wrote a dialogue of about 24 pages: ""Cleanthes, or the Starting Point and Necessary Continuation of Philosophy."" Here art and science, which had become completely divorced from each other, were to some extent united, and like a vigorous traveller I set a bout the task itself, a philosophical-dialectical account of divinity, as it manifests itself as the idea-in-itself, as religion, as nature, and as history. My last proposition was the beginning of the Hegelian system. * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0For some days my vexation made me quite incapable of thinking; I ran about madly in the garden by the dirty water of the Spree, which ""washes souls and dilutes the tea .""l I even joined my landlord in a hunting excursion, rushed off to Berlin and wanted to embrace every street-corner loafer.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0 Owning to being upset over Jenny\'s illness and my vain, fruitless intellectual labours, and as the result of nagging annoyance at having had to make an idol of a view that I hated, I became ill, as I have already written to you, dear Father. When I got better I burnt all the poems and outlines of stories, etc., imagining that I could give them up completely, of which so far at any rate I have not given any proofs to the contrary.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 While I was ill I got to know Hegel from beginning to end, together with most of his disciples. Through a n umber of meetings with friends in Stralow I came across a Doctors\' Club,2 which includes some university lecturers and my most intimate Berlin friend, Dr. Rutenberg. In controversy h ere, many conflicting views were expressed, and I became ever more firmly bound to the modern world philosophy from which I had thought to escape. * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0* * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Your ever loving son,  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Karl   \xa0\xa0\xa0Please, dear father, excuse my illegible handwriting and bad style; it is almost 4 o\'clock, the candle has burnt itself out, and my eyes are dim; a real unrest has taken possession of me, I shall not be able to calm the turbulent spectres until I am with you who are dear to me.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Please give greetings from me to my sweet, wonderful Jenny.

What this would mean Marx hinted in the dissertation\'s foreword, where he saluted Prometheus\' revolt against the gods as a proclamation of ""human self-consciousness as the highest divinity."" To transform the world in the image of Hegelian philosophy would mean to make of man in existential reality the divinity that, as Marx saw it, Hegel had a1ready made him in thought. ""  \xa0\xa0\xa0The last two paragraphs of the selection are taken from Marx\'s preparatory material for the dissertation, ""Notebooks on Epicurean Philosophy.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0   * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0Also in relation to Hegel it is mere ignorance on the part of his pupils, when they explain one or the other determination of his system by his desire for accommodation and the like, hence, in one word, explain it in terms of morality. They forget that only a short time ago they were enthusiastic about all his idiosyncrasies  , as can be clearly demonstrated from their writings.  \xa0\xa0\xa0If they were really so affected by the ready-made science they acquired that they gave themselves up to it in naive uncritical trust, then how unscrupulous is their attempt to reproach the Master for a hidden intention behind his insight! The Master, to whom the science was not something received, but something in the process of becoming, to whose uttermost periphery his own intellectual heart\'s blood was pulsating! On the contrary, they rendered themselves suspect of not having been serious before. And now they oppose their own former condition, and ascribe it to Hegel, forgetting however that his relation to his system was immediate, substantial, while theirs is only a reflected one.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is a psychological law that the theoretical mind, once liberated in itself, turns into practical energy, and, leaving the shadowy empire of Amenthes as will, turns itself against the reality of the world existing without it. ( From a philosophical point of view, however, it is important to specify these aspects better, since from the specific manner of this turn we can reason back towards the immanent determination and the universal historic character of a philosophy. We see here, as it were, its curriculum vitae 1 narrowed down to its subjective point.) But the  practice of philosophy is itself theoretical. It\'s the critique that measures the individual existence by the essence, the particular reality by the Idea. But this immediate realization of philosophy is in its deepest essence afflicted with con\xad tradictions, and this its essence takes form in the appearance and imprints its seal upon it.  \xa0\xa0\xa0When philosophy turns itself as will against the world of appearance, then the system is lowered to an abstract totality, that is, it has become one aspect of the world which opposes another one. Its relationship to the world is that of reflection. Inspired by the urge to realise itself, it enters into tension against the other. The inner self-contentment and completeness has been broken. What was inner light has become consuming flame turning outwards. The result is that as the world becomes philosophical, philosophy also becomes worldly, that its realisation is also its loss, that what it struggles against on the outside is its own inner deficiency, that in the very struggle it falls precisely into those defects which it fights as defects in the opposite camp, and that it can only overcome these defects by falling into them. That which opposes it and that which it fights is always the same as itself, only with factors inverted.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This is the one side, when we consider this matter purely objec\xad tively as immediate realisation of philosophy. However, it has also a subjective; aspect, which is merely another form of it. This is the relationship of the philosophical system which is realised to its intel-\xad lectual carriers, to the individual self-consciousnesses in which its progress appears. This relationship results in what confronts the world in the realisation of philosophy itself, namely, in the fact that these individual self-consciousnesses always carry a double-edged demand, one edge turned against the world, the other against philosophy itself. Indeed, what in the thing itself appears as a relationship inverted in itself, appears in these self-consciousnesses as a double one, a demand and an action contradicting each other.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Their liberation of the world from the philosophy that held them in fetters as a particular system. * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0As in the history of philosophy there are nodal points which raise philosophy in itself to concretion, apprehend abstract principles in a totality, and thus break off the rectilinear process, so also there are moments when philosophy turns its eyes to the external world, and no longer apprehends it, but, as a practical person, weaves, as it were, intrigues with the world, emerges from the transparent kingdom of Amenthes and throws itself on the breast of the worldly Siren. That is the carnival of philosophy, whether it disguises itself as a dog like the Cynic, in priestly vestments like the Alexandrian, or in fragrant spring array like the Epicurean. It is essential that philosophy should then wear character masks. As Deucalion, according to the legend, cast stones behind him in creating human beings, so philosophy casts its regard behind it (the bones of its mother are luminous eyes) when its heart is set on creating a world; but as Prometheus, having stolen fire from heaven, begins to build houses and to settle upon the earth, so philosophy, expanded to be the whole world, turns against the world of appearance. The same now with the philosophy of Hegel.  \xa0\xa0\xa0While philosophy has sealed itself off to form a consummate, total world, the determination of this totality is conditioned by the general development of philosophy, just as that development is the condition of the form in which philosophy turns into a practical relationship towards reality; thus the totality of the world in general is divided within itself, and this division is carried to the extreme, for spiritual existence has been freed, has been enriched to universality, the heart-beat has become in itself the differentiation in the concrete form which is the whole organism. The division of the world is total only when its aspects are totalities. The world confronting a philosophy total in itself is therefore a world torn apart. This philosophy\'s activity therefore also appears torn apart and contradictory; its objective universality is turned back into the subjective forms of individual consciousness in which it has life. But one must not let oneself be misled by this storm which follows a great philosophy, a world philosophy. Ordinary harps play under any fingers, Aeolian harps only when struck by the storm.  \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 * * *  \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0   For a Ruthless Criticism  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0  Of  Everything Existing  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 KARL MARX  \xa0\xa0\xa0The watchword of the young Karl Marx, as of his Young Hegelian associates generally, was Kritik-criticism. In this early article, printed in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher in 1844 in the form of a letter to Arnold Ruge, Marx elaborated the idea of criticism into a program of this journal, of which he and Ruge were editors. His future strictures on utopian socialist plans, in the Communist Manifesto and other later writings, were prefigured in the dismissal here of the communist utopias of writers like Etienne Cabet as a ""dogmatic abstraction."" The Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher (German-French Annals) came out in Paris in February, 1844, in the German language. Only one double issue of the journal was published.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The translation was made by Dr. Ronald Rogowski for this edition.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 M. to R.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  Kreuznach  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 September, 1843  \xa0\xa0\xa0 I am delighted that you are resolved and turn your thoughts from backward glances at the past toward a new undertaking. In Paris, then, the old university of philosophy (absit omen!) and the new capital of the new world. What is necessary will arrange itself. I do not doubt, therefore, that all obstacles-whose importance I do not fail to recognize-will be removed.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 The undertaking may succeed, however, or not; in any case I will be in Paris at the end of this month, since the air here makes one servile and I see no room at all in Germany for free activity.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In Germany, everything is being forcibly repressed, a true anarchy of the spirit has burst out, stupidity itself reigns supreme, and Zurich obeys commands from Berlin; hence it becomes ever clearer that a new\' gathering point must be sought for the really thinking and independent minds. I am convinced that our plan would meet a real need, and real needs must surely also be able to find real fulfillment. I therefore have no doubts about the enterprise if only we undertake it seriously.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The inner difficulties seem to be almost greater than the external obstacles. For even if there is no doubt about the ""whence;"" all the more confusion reigns about the ""whither."" Apart from the general anarchy which has erupted among the reformers, each is compelled to confess to himself that he has no clear conception of what the future should be. That, however, is just the advantage of the new trend: that we do not attempt dogmatically to prefigure the future, but want to find the new world only through criticism of the old. Up to now the philosophers had the solution of all riddles lying in their lectern, and the stupid uninitiated world had only to open its jaws to let the roast partridges of absolute science fly into its mouth. Now philosophy has become worldly, and the most incontrovertible evidence of this is that the philosophical consciousness has been drawn, not only externally but also internally, into the stress of battle. But if the designing of the future and the proclamation of ready-made solutions for all time is not our affair, then we realize all the more clearly what we have to accomplish in the present-I am speaking of a ruthless criticism of everything existing, ruthless in two senses : The criticism must not be afraid of its own conclusions, nor of conflict with the powers that be.  \xa0\xa0\xa0I am therefore not in favor of setting up any dogmatic flag. On the contrary, we must try to help the dogmatics to clarify to themselves the meaning of their own positions. Thus communism, to be specific, is a dogmatic abstraction. I do not have in mind here some imaginary, possible communism, but actually existing communism in the form preached by Cabet, Dezamy,1 Weitling,2 etc. This communism is only a special manifestation of the humanistic principle which is still infected by its opposite-private being. Elimina\xadtion of private property is therefore by no means identical with this communism, and it is not accidental but quite inevitable that communism has seen other socialist teachings arise in opposition to it, such as the teachings of Fourier, Proudhon, etc., because it is itself only a special, one-sided realization of the socialist principle.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 And the socialist principle itself represents, on the whole, only one side, affecting the reality of the true human essence. We have to concern ourselves just as much with the other side, the theoretical existence of man, in other words to make religion, science, etc., the objects of our criticism. Moreover, we want to have an effect on our contemporaries, and specifically on our German contemporaries. The question is, how is this to be approached? Two circumstances cannot be denied. First, religion, and second, politics, arouse predominant interest in contemporary Germany. We must take these two subjects, however they are, for a starting-point, and not set up against them some ready-made system such as the Voyage en Icarie.3 \xa0Reason has always existed, only not always in reasonable form .  \xa0\xa0\xa0The critic can therefore start out by taking any form of theoretical and practical consciousness and develop from the unique forms of existing reality the true reality as its norm and final goal. Now so far as real life is concerned, precisely the political state in all its modern forms contains, even where it is not yet consciously imbued with socialist demands, the demands of reason. Nor does the state stop at that. The state everywhere presupposes that reason has been realized. But in just this way it everywhere comes into contradiction between its ideal mission and its real preconditions.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 çµOut of this conflict of the political state with itself, therefore, one can develop social truth. Just as religion is the catalogue of the theoretical struggles of mankind, so the political state is the catalogue of its practical struggles. The political state thus expresses, within the confines of its form sub specie rei publicae,4 all social struggles, needs, truths. Thus it is not at all beneath the hauteur des principles to make the most specific political question-e.g., the difference between the corporative5 and the representative system-the object of criticism. For this question only expresses in a political way the difference between the rule of man and the rule of private property. The critic therefore not only can but must go into these political questions (which the crass kind of socialists consider beneath anyone\'s dignity) . By showing the superiority of the representative system over the corporative system, the critic affects the practical interests of a large party. By elevating the representative system from its political form to its general form and by bringing out the true significance underlying this system, the critic at the same time forces this party to go beyond its own confines, since its victory is at the same time its loss.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Nothing prevents us, then, from tying our criticism to the criticism of politics and to a definite party position in politics, and hence from identifying our criticism with real struggles. Then we shall confront the world not as doctrinaires with a new principle: ""Here is the truth, bow down before it!"" We develop new principles to the world out of its own principles. We do not say to the world: ""Stop fighting; your struggle is of no account. We want to shout the true slogan of the struggle at you."" We only show the world what it is fighting for, and consciousness is something that the world must acquire, like it or not.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The reform of consciousness consists only in enabling the world to clarify its consciousness, in waking it from its dream about itself, in explaining to it the meaning of its own actions. Our whole task can consist only in putting religious and political questions into self-conscious human form-as is also the case in Feuerbach\'s criticism of religion.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Our motto must therefore be: Reform of consciousness not through dogmas, but through analyzing the mystical consciousness, the consciousness which is unclear to itself, whether it appears in religious or political form. Then it will transpire that the world has long been dreaming of something that it can acquire if only it becomes conscious of it. It will transpire that it is not a matter of drawing a great dividing line between past and future, but of carrying out the thoughts of the past. And finally, it will transpire that mankind begins no new work, but consciously accomplishes its old work.  \xa0\xa0\xa0So, we can express the trend of our journal in one word: the work of our time to clarify to itself (critical philosophy) the meaning of its own struggle and its own desires. This is work for the world and for us. It can only be the work of joint forces. It is a matter of confession, no more. To have its sins forgiven mankind has only to declare them to be what they really are.  Contribution to the Critique of Hegel\'s  Philosophy of Right  KARL MARX  \xa0\xa0\xa0In line with his program of effecting ""a ruthless criticism of everything existing,"" Marx during 1843 took up the criticism of politics, He set a bout this by working on a commentary on Hegel\'s treatise on the state, * To the Hegelian political philosophy (which he called, following Feuerbach, ""speculative philosophy"") he applied the method of ""transformational criticism"" that Feuerbach had applied to the Hegelian philosophy of religion,* * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0Although the work was left incomplete and unpublished, it was, as Marx later said (see p. 4, above), a milestone on his road to historical materialism: it led him to the view that instead of the state being the basis of ""civil society,"" as Hegel held, civil or bourgeois society is the basis of the state.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Despite its incompleteness-the extant part of the commentary starts with paragraph 261 of Hegel\'s treatise and deals only with selected further sections up to paragraph 308-this work remains of interest as Marx\'s most extensive single piece of purely political writing, although his standpoint at the time of writing was no more than proto-Marxist.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The State and Civil Society1  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  \xa0The idea is made the subject and the actual relation of family and civil society to the state is conceived as its internal imaginary activity. Family and civil society are the premises of the state; they are the genuinely active elements, but in speculative philosophy things are inverted. When the idea is made the subject, however, the real subjects, namely, civil society, family, ""circumstances, caprice, etc.,"" become unreal objective elements of the idea with a changed significance.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  \xa0Rationally interpreted, Hegel\'s propositions would mean only this : The family and civil society are parts of the state. The material of the state is distributed amongst them ""by circumstances, cap\xad rice and the individual\'s own choice of vocation."" The citizens of the state are members of families and members of civil society.  \xa0\xa0\xa0""The actual idea, mind, divides itself into the two ideal spheres of its concept, family and civil society, that is, its finite phase""-\xad hence, the division of the state into family and civil society is ideal, i.e., necessary as part of the essence of the state. Family and civil society are actual components of the state, actual spiritual existences of the will; they are modes of existence of the state. Family and civil society constitute themselves as the state. They are the driving force. According to Hegel, they are, on the contrary, produced by the actual idea. It is not the course of their own life which unites them in the state; on the contrary, it is the idea which in the course of its life has separated them off from itself. Indeed, they are the finiteness of this idea. They owe their presence to another mind than their own. They are entities determined by a third party, not self-determined entities. Accordingly, they are also defined as ""finiteness,"" as the ""actual idea\'s"" own finiteness. The purpose of their being is not this being itself; rather, the idea separates these presuppositions off from itself ""so as to emerge from their ideality as explicitly infinite actual mind."" That is to say, there can be no political state without the natural basis of the family and the artificial basis of civil society; they are for it a conditio sine qua non. But the condition is postulated as the conditioned, the determinant as the determined, the producing factor as the product of its product. The actual idea only degrades itself into the ""finiteness"" of the family and civil society so as by transcending them to enjoy and bring forth its infinity. ""Accordingly"" (in order to achieve its purpose), it ""assigns to these spheres the material of this, its finite actuality"" (this? which? these spheres are indeed its ""finite actuality,"" its ""material"" ), ""individuals as a multitude"" (""the individuals, the multitude"" are here the material of the state; ""the state consists of them""; this composition of the state is here expressed as an act of the idea, as an ""allocation"" which it undertakes with its own material The fact is that the state issues from the multitude in their existence as members of families and as members of civil society. Speculative philosophy expresses this fact as the idea\'s deed, not as the idea of the multitude, but as the deed of a subjective idea different from the fact itself), ""in such a way that with regard to the individual this assignment"" (previously the discussion was only about the assignment of individuals to the spheres of the family and civil society) ""appears mediated by circumstances, caprice, etc."" Empirical actuality is thus accepted as it is. It is also expressed as rational, but it is not rational on account of its own reason, but because the empirical fact in its empirical existence has a different significance from it itself. The fact which is taken as a point of departure is not conceived as such, but as a mystical result. The actual becomes a phenomenon, but the idea has no other content than this phenomenon. Nor has the idea any other purpose than the logical one of being ""explicitly infinite actual mind."" The entire mystery of the philosophy of law and of Hegel\'s philosophy as a whole is set out in this paragraph.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0If Hegel had set out from real subjects as the bases of the state he would not have found it necessary to transform the state in a mystical fashion into a subject. ""In its truth, however,"" says Hegel, ""subjectivity exists only as subject, personality only as person."" This too is a piece of mystification. Subjectivity is a characteristic of the subject, personality a characteristic of the person. Instead of conceiving them as predicates of their subjects. Hegel gives the predicates an independent existence and subsequently transforms them in a mystical fashion into their subjects.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The existence of predicates is the subject, so that the subject is the existence of subjectivity, etc.; Hegel transforms the predicates, the objects, into independent entities, but divorced from their actual independence, their subject. Subsequently the actual subject appears as a result, whereas one must start from the actual subject and look at its objectification. The mystical substance, therefore, becomes the actual subject, and the real subject appears as something else, as an element of the mystical substance. Precisely because Hegel starts from the predicates of the general description instead of from the real ens (lnr0XEtltn\'ov, subject), and since, nevertheless, there has to be a bearer of these qualities, the mystical idea becomes this bearer. The dualism consists in the fact that Hegel does not look upon the general as being the actual nature of the actual finite, i.e., of what exists and is determinate, or upon the actual ens as the true subject of the infinite.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  Sovereignty  \xa0\xa0\xa0So in this case sovereignty, the essential feature of the state, is treated to begin with as an independent entity, is objectified. Then, of course, this objective entity has to become a subject again. This subject then appears, however, as a self-incarnation of sovereignty; whereas sovereignty is nothing but the objectifed mind of the subjects of the state.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0As if the actual state were not the people. The state is an abstraction. The people alone is what is concrete. And it is remarkable that Hegel, who without hesitation attributes a living quality such as sovereignty to the abstraction, attributes it only with hesitation and reservations to something concrete. ""The usual sense, however, in which men have recently begun to speak of the sovereignty of the people is in opposition to the sovereignty existing in the monarch. In this antithesis the sovereignty of the people is one of those confused notions which are rooted in the wild idea of the people.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0The ""confused notions"" and the ""wild idea"" are here exclusively Hegel\'s. To be sure, if sovereignty exists in the monarch, then it is foolish to speak of an antithetical sovereignty in the people; for it is implied in the concept of sovereignty that sovereignty can\xad not have a double existence, still less one which is contradictory. However:  \xa0\xa0\xa01) This is just the question: Is not that sovereignty which is claimed by the monarch an illusion? Sovereignty of the monarch or sovereignty of the people-that is the question.  \xa0\xa0\xa02) One can also speak of a sovereignty of the people in opposi tion to the sovereignty existing in the monarch. But then it is not a question of one and the same sovereignty which has arisen on two sides, but two entirely contradictory concepts of sovereignty, the one a sovereignty such as can come to exist in a monarch, the other such as can come to exist only in a people. It is the same with the question: ""Is God sovereign, or is man?"" One of the two is an untruth, even if an existing untruth.  \xa0\xa0\xa0""Taken without its monarch and the articulation of the whole which is necessarily and directly associated with the monarch, the people .is that formless mass which is no longer a state. It no longer possesses any of the atrributes which are to be found only in an internally organized whole-sovereignty, government, courts of law, the administration, estates of the realm, etc. With the appearance in a nation of such factors, which relate to organisation, to the life of the state, a people ceases to be that indeterminate abstraction, which, as a purely general notion, is called the nation."" All this is a tautology. If a people has a monarch and the structure that neces- sarily and directly goes with a monarch, i.e., if it is structured as a monarchy, then indeed, taken out of this structure, it is a formless mass and a purely general notion. ""If by sovereignty of the people is understood a republican form of government and, more specifically, democracy...then...there can be no further discussion of such a notion in face of the developed idea."" That is indeed right, if one has only ""such a notion"" and not a ""developed idea"" of democracy.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Democracy  \xa0\xa0\xa0Democracy is the truth of monarchy; monarchy is not the truth of democracy. Monarchy is necessarily democracy inconsistent with itself; the monarchical element is not an inconsistency in democracy. Monarchy cannot be understood in its own terms; democracy can. In democracy none of the elements attains a significance other than what is proper to it. Each is in actual fact only an element of the whole demos . In monarchy one part determines the character of the whole. The entire constitution has to adapt itself to this fixed point. Democracy is the genus Constitution. Monarchy is one species, and a poor one at that. Democracy is content and form. Monarchy is supposed to be only a form, but it falsifies the content.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In monarchy the whole, the people, is subsumed under one of its particular modes of being, the political constitution. In democracy the constitution itself appears only as one determination, that is, the self-determination of the people. In monarchy we have the people of the constitution; in democracy the constitution of the people. Democracy is the solved riddle of all constitutions. Here, not merely implicitly and in essence but existing in reality, the con-\xad stitution is constantly brought back to its actual basis, the actual human being, the actual people, and established as the people\'s own work. The constitution appears as what it is, a free product of man. It could be said that in a certain respect this applies also to consti-\xad tutional monarchy; but the specific distinguishing feature of democracy is that here the constitution as such forms only one element in the life of the people-that it is not the political constitution by itself which forms the state.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Hegel starts from the state and makes man the subjectified state; democracy starts from man and makes the state objectified man. Just as it is not religion which creates man but man who creates religion, so it is not the constitution which creates the people but the people which creates the constitution. In a certain respect the relation of democracy to all other forms of state is like the relation of Christianity to all other religions. Christianity is the religion INSERT TEXT,2the essence of religion-deified man as a particular religion. Similarly, democracy is the essence of all state constitutions-social-\xad ised man as a particular state constitution. Democracy stands to the other constitutions as the genus stands to its species; except that here the genus itself appears as an existent, and therefore as one particular species over against the others whose existence does not correspond to their essence. To democracy all other forms of state stand as its Old Testament. Man does not exist for the law but the law for man-it is a human manifestation; whereas in the other forms of state man is a legal manifestation. That is the fundamental distinction of democracy.  \xa0\xa0\xa0All other state forms are definite, distinct, particular forms of state. In democracy the formal principle is at the same time the material principle. Only democracy, therefore, is the true unity of the general and the particular. In monarchy, for example, and in the republic as a merely particular form of state, political man has his particular mode of being alongside unpolitical man, man as a private individual. Property, contract, marriage, civil society, all appear here (as Hegel shows quite correctly with regard to these abstract state forms, but he thinks that he is expounding the idea of the state) as particular modes of existence alongside the political state, as the content to which the political state is related as organising form; properly speaking, the relation of the political state to this content is merely that of reason, inherently without content, which defines and delimits, which now affirms and now denies. In democracy the political state, which stands alongside this content and distinguishes itself from it, is itself merely a particular content and particular form of existence of the people. In monarchy, for example, this particular, the political constitution, has the significance of the general that dominates and determines everything particular. In democracy the state as particular is merely particular; as general, it is the truly general, i .e., not something determinate in distinction from the other content. The French have recently interpreted this as meaning that in true democracy the political state is annihilated. This is correct insofar as the political state qua political state, as constitution, no longer passes for the whole.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In all states other than democratic ones the state, the law, the constitution is what rules, without really ruling-i.e., without materially permeating the content of the remaining, non-political spheres. In democracy the constitution, the law, the state itself, insofar as it is a political constitution, is only the self-determination of the people, and a particular content of the people.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Incidentally, it goes without saying that all forms of state have democracy for their truth and that they are therefore untrue insofar as they are not democracy.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Politics: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern  \xa0\xa0\xa0In the states of antiquity the political state makes up the content of the state to the exclusion of the other spheres. The modern state is a compromise between the political and the unpolitical state.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In democracy the abstract state has ceased to be the dominant factor. The struggle between monarchy and republic is itself still a struggle within the abstract state. The political republic is democracy within the abstract state form. The abstract state form of democracy is therefore the republic; but here it ceases to be the merely political constitution.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Property, etc., in short, the entire content of the law and the state, is the same in North America as in Prussia, with few modifications. The republic there is thus a mere state form, as is the monarchy here. The content of the state lies outside these constitutions. Hegel is right, therefore, when he says: The political state is the constitution, i.e., the material state is not political. What obtains here is merely an external identity, a determination of changing forms. Of the various elements of national life, the one most difficult to evolve was the political state, the constitution. It developed as universal reason over against the other spheres, as ulterior to them. The historical task then consisted in its  reassertion, but the particular spheres do not realise that their private nature coincides with the other-worldly nature of the constitution or of the political state, and that the other-worldly existence of the political state is nothing but the affirmation of their own estrangement. Up till now the political constitution has been the religious sphere, the religion of national life, the heaven of its gener\xad- ality over against the earthy existence of its actuality. The political sphere has been the only state sphere in the state, the only sphere in which the content as well as the form has been species-content, the truly general; but in such a way that at the same time, because this sphere has confronted the others, its content has also become formal and particular. Political life in the modern sense is the scho-\xad lasticism of national life. Monarchy is the perfect expression of this estrangement. The republic is the negation of this estrangement within its own sphere. It is obvious that the political constitution as such is brought into being only where the private spheres have won an independent existence. Where trade and landed property are not free and have not yet become independent, the political constitution too does not yet exist. The Middle Ages were the democracy of unfreedom.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The abstraction of the state as such belongs only to modern times, because the abstraction of private life belongs only to modern times. The abstraction of the political state is a modern product.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In the Middle Ages there were serfs, feudal estates, merchant and trade guilds, corporations of scholars, etc.: that is to say, in the Middle Ages property, trade, society, man are political; the material content of the state is given by its form; every private sphere has a political character or is a political sphere; that is, politics is a characteristic of the private spheres too. In the Middle Ages the political constitution is the constitution of private property, but only because the constitution of private property is a political constitution. In the Middle Ages the life of the nation and the life of the state are identical. Man is the actual principle of the state-but unfree man. It is thus the democracy of unfreedom-estrangement carried to completion. The abstract reflected antithesis belongs only to the modern world. The Middle Ages are the period of actual dualism; modern times, one of abstract dualism.  \xa0\xa0\xa0""We have already noted the stage at which the division of constitutions into democracy, aristocracy and monarchy has been made\xad the standpoint, that is, of that unity which is still substantial, which still remains within itself, and has not yet come to its process of infmite differentiation and inner deepening,: at that stage, the element of the final self-determining resolution of the will does not emerge explicitly into its own proper actuality as an immanent factor in the state."" In the spontaneously evolved monarchy, democracy and aristocracy there is as yet no political constitution as distinct from the actual, material state or the other content of the life of the nation. The political state does not yet appear as the form of the material state. Either, as in Greece, the  res publica 3 is the real private affair of the citizens, their real content, and the private individual is a slave; the political state, qua political state, being the true and only content of the life and will of the citizens; or, as in an Asiatic despotism, the political state is nothing but the personal caprice of a single individual; or the political state, like the material state, is a slave. What distinguishes the modern state from these states characterized by the substantial unity between people and state is not, as Hegel would have it, that the various elements of the constitution have been developed into particular actuality, but that the constitution itself has been developed into a particular actuality alongside the actual life of the people\xad- that the political state has become the constitution of the rest of the state.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Bureaucracy  \xa0\xa0\xa0The ""state formalism"" which bureaucracy is, is the ""state as formalism""; and it is as a formalism of this kind that Hegel has described bureaucracy. Since this ""state formalism"" constitutes itself as an actual power and itself becomes its own material content, it goes without saying that the ""bureaucracy"" is a web of practical illusions, or the ""illusion of the state."" The bureaucratic spirit is a jesuitical, theological spirit through and through. The bureaucrats are the jesuits and theologians of the state. The bureaucracy is la republique pretre.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Since by its very nature the bureaucracy is the ""state as formalism,"" it is this also as regards its purpose. The actual purpose of the state therefore appears to the bureaucracy as an objective hostile to the state. The spirit of the bureaucracy is the ""formal state spirit."" The bureaucracy therefore turns the ""formal state spirit"" or the actual spiritless ness of the state into a categorical imperative. The bureaucracy takes itself to be the ultimate purpose of the state. Because the bureaucracy turns its ""formal"" objectives into its content, it comes into conflict everywhere with ""real"" objectives. It is therefore obliged to pass off the form for the content and the content for the form. State objectives are transformed into objectives of the department, and department objectives into objectives of the state. The bureaucracy is a circle from which no one can escape. Its hierarchy is a hierarchy of knowledge. The top entrusts the under\xad standing of detail to the lower levels, whilst the lower levels credit the top with understanding of the general, and so all are mutually deceived.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The bureaucracy is the imaginary state alongside the real state\xad the spiritualism of the state. Each thing has therefore a double meaning, a real and a bureaucratic meaning, just as knowledge (and also the will) is both real and bureaucratic. The really existing, however, is treated in the light of its bureaucratic nature, its other\xad worldly, spiritual essence. The bureaucracy has the state, the spiritual essence of society, in its possession, as its private property. The general spirit of the bureaucracy is the secret, the mystery, preserved within itself by the hierarchy and against the outside world by being a closed corporation. Avowed political spirit, as also political\xadmindedness, therefore appear to the bureaucracy as treason against its mystery. Hence, authority is the basis of its knowledge, and the deification of authority is its conviction. Within the bureaucracy itself, however, spiritualism becomes crass materialism, the materialism of passive obedience, of faith in authority, of the mechanism of fixed and formalistic behaviour, and of fixed principles, views and traditions. In the case of the individual bureaucrat, the state objec\xad tive turns into his private objective, into a after higher posts, the making of a career. In the first place, he looks on actual, life as something material, for the spirit of this life has its distinctly separate existence in the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy must therefore proceed to make life as material as possible. Secondly, actual life is material for the bureaucrat himself, i .e., so far as it becomes an object of bureaucratic manipulation; for his spirit is prescribed for him, his aim lies beyond him, and his existence is the existence of the department. The state only continues to exist as various fixed bureaucratic minds, bound together in subordination and passive obedience. Actual knowledge seems devoid of content, just as actual life seems dead; for this imaginary knowledge and this imaginary life are taken for the real thing. The bureaucrat must therefore deal with the actual state jesuitically, whether this jesuitry is conscious or unconscious. However, once its antithesis is knowledge, this jesuitry is like wise bound to achieve self-consciousness and then become deliberate jesuitry.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Whilst the bureaucracy is on the one hand this crass materialism, it manifests its crass spiritualism in the fact that it wants to do everything, i.e., by making the will the causa prima. For it is purely an active form of existence and receives its content from without and can prove its existence, therefore, only by shaping and restricting this content. For the bureaucrat the world is a mere object to be manipulated by him.  \xa0\xa0\xa0When Hegel calls the executive the objective aspect of the sovereignty dwelling in the monarch, that is right in the same sense in which the Catholic Church was the real presence of the sovereignty, substance and spirit of the Holy Trinity. In the bureaucracy the identity of state interest and particular private aim is established in such a way that the state interest becomes a particular private aim over against other private aims.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The abolition of the bureaucracy is only possible by the general interest actually-and not, as with Hegel, merely in thought, in abstraction-becoming the particular interest, which in turn is onlv possible as a result of the particular actually becoming the general interest. Hegel starts from an unreal antithesis and therefore achieves only an imaginary identity which is in truth again a contra- dictory identity. The bureaucracy is just such an identity.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 * * *  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 On the Jewish Question  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 KARL MARX  \xa0\xa0\xa0In this essay, written in the autumn of 1843 and published in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher, Marx pursued his critical aims through a review of two studies on the Jewish question by another Young Hegelian, Bruno Bauer. The criticism of politics is developed in the first part, leading to the conclusion that human emancipation requires the ending of the division between man as an egoistic being in ""civil society"" and man as abstract citizen in the state. In the second part, Marx proceeds to the criticism of economics or commerce, which he equates with ""Judaism."" His concluding call for ""the emancipation of society from Judaism"" (which has been seen on occasion as a manifesto of anti-Semitism) is in fact a call for the emancipation of society from what he here calls ""huckstering,"" or from what he was subsequently to call ""capitalism."" This, however, is not to deny that Marx, although he himself was of Jewish origin, harbored antiJewish attitudes, nor is it to deny that such attitudes found expression in this essay.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa01. Bruno Bauer, Die Judenfrage1  \xa0\xa0\xa0The German Jews seek emancipation. What kind of emancipation do they want? Civic, political emancipation.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Bruno Bauer replies to them: In Germany no one is politically emancipated. We ourselves are not free. How then could we liberate you? You Jews are egoists if you demand for yourselves, as Jews, a special emancipation. You should work, as Germans, for the political emancipation of Germany, and as men, for the emancipation of mankind. You should feel the particular kind of oppression and shame which you suffer, not as an exception to the rule but rather as a confirmation of the rule.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Or do the Jews want to be placed on a footing of equality with the Christian subjects? If they recognize the Christian state as legally established they also recognize the regime of general enslavement. Why should their particular yoke be irksome when they accept the general yoke? Why should the German be interested in the liberation of the Jew, if the Jew is not interested in the liberation of the German?  \xa0\xa0\xa0The Christian state recognizes nothing but privileges. The Jew himself, in this state, has the privilege of being a Jew. As a Jew he possesses rights which the Christians do not have. Why does he want rights which he does not have but which the Christians enjoy?  \xa0\xa0\xa0In demanding his emancipation from the Christian state he asks the Christian state to abandon its religious prejudice. But does he, the Jew, give up his religious prejudice? Has he then the right to insist that someone else should forswear his religion?  \xa0\xa0\xa0The Christian state, by its very nature, is incapable of emancipating the Jew. But, adds Bauer, the Jew, by his very nature, cannot be emancipated. As long as the state remains Christian, and as long as the Jew remains a Jew, they are equally incapable, the one of conferring emancipation, the other of receiving it.  \xa0\xa0\xa0With respect to the Jews the Christian state can only adopt the attitude of a Christian state. That is, it can permit the Jew, as a matter of privilege, to isolate himself from its other subjects; but it must then allow the pressures of all the other spheres of society to bear upon the Jew, and all the more heavily since he is in religious opposition to the dominant religion. But the Jew likewise can only adopt a Jewish attitude, i.e. that of a foreigner, towards the state, since he opposes his illusory nationality to actual nationality, his illusory law to actual law. He considers it his right to separate himself from the rest of humanity; as a matter of principle he takes no part in the historical movement and looks to a future which has nothing in common with the future of mankind as a whole. He regards himself as a member of the Jewish people, and the Jewish people as the chosen people.  \xa0\xa0\xa0On what grounds, then, do you Jews demand emancipation? On account of your religion? But it is the mortal enemy of the state religion. As citizens? But there are no citizens in Germany. As men? But you are not men any more than are those to whom you appeal.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 Bauer, after criticizing earlier approaches and solutions, formulates the question of Jewish emancipation in a new way. What, he asks, is the nature of the Jew who is to be emancipated, and the nature of the Christian state which is to emancipate him? He replies by a critique of the Jewish religion, analyses the religious opposition between Judaism and Christianity, explains the essence of the Christian state; and does all this with dash, clarity, wit and profundity, in a style which is as precise as it is pithy and vigorous.  \xa0\xa0\xa0How then does Bauer resolve the Jewish question? What is the result? To formulate a question is to resolve it. The critical study of the Jewish question is the answer to the Jewish question. Here it is in brief : we have to emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The most stubborn form of the opposition between Jew and Christian is the religious opposition. How is an opposition resolved? By making it impossible. And how is religious opposition made impossible? By abolishing religion. As soon as Jew and Christian come to see in their respective religions nothing more than stages in the development of the human mind-snake skins which have been cast off by history, and man as the snake who clothed himself in them-they will no longer find themselves in religious opposition, but in a purely critical, scientific and human relationship. Science will then constitute their unity. But scientific oppositions are resolved by science itself.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The German Jew, in particular, suffers from the general lack of political freedom and the pronounced Christianity of the state. But in Bauer\'s sense the Jewish question has a general significance, independent of the specifically German conditions. It is the question of the relations between religion and the state, of the contradiction between religious prejudice and political emancipation. Emancipation from religion is posited as a condition, both for the Jew who wants political emancipation, and for the state which should emancipate him and itself be emancipated.  \xa0\xa0\xa0""Very well, it may be said ( and the Jew himself says it) but the Jew should not be emancipated because he is a Jew, because he has such an excellent and universal moral creed; the Jew should take second place to the citizen, and he will be a citizen although he is and desires to remain a Jew. In other words, he is and remains a Jew, even though he is a citizen and as such lives in a universal human condition; his restricted Jewish nature always finally triumphs over his human and political obligations. The bias persists even though it is overcome by general principles. But if it persists, it would be truer to say that it overcomes all the rest."" ""It is only in a sophistical and superficial sense that the Jew could remain a Jew in political life. Consequently, if he wanted to remain a Jew, this would mean that the superficial became the essential and thus triumphed. In other words, his life in the state would be only a semblance, or a momentary exception to the essential and normal. ""2  \xa0\xa0\xa0Let us see also how Bauer establishes the role of the state. ""France,"" he says, ""has provided us recently,3 in connexion with the Jewish question ( and for that matter all other political questions ), with the spectacle of a life which is free but which revokes its freedom by law and so declares it to be merely an appearance; and which, on the other hand, denies its free laws by its acts.""4  \xa0\xa0\xa0""In France, universal liberty is not yet established by law, nor is the Jewish question as yet resolved, because legal liberty, i .e. the equality of all citizens, is restricted in actual life, which is still dominated and fragmented by religious privileges, and because the lack of liberty in actual life influences law in its turn and obliges it to sanction the division of citizens who are by nature free into oppressors and oppressed.""5  \xa0\xa0\xa0When, therefore, would the Jewish question be resolved in France?  \xa0\xa0\xa0""The Jew would really have ceased to be Jewish, for example, if he did not allow his religions code to prevent his fulfilment of his duties towards the state and his fellow citizens; if he attended and took part in the public business of the Chamber of Deputies on the sabbath. It would be necessary, further, to abolish all religious privliege, including the monopoly of a privileged church. If, thereafter, some or many or even the overwhelming majority felt obliged to fulfil their religious duties, such practices should be left to them as an absolutely private matter.""6 ""There is no longer any religion when there is no longer a privileged religion. Take away from religion its power to excommunicate and it will no longer exist.""7 ""Mr. Martin du Nord has seen, in the suggestion to omit any mention of Sunday in the law, a proposal to declare that Christianity has ceased to exist. With equal right ( and the right is well founded ) the declaration that the law of the sabbath is no longer binding upon the Jew would amount to proclaiming the end of Judaism.""8  \xa0\xa0\xa0Thus Bauer demands, on the one hand, that the Jew should renounce Judaism, and in general that man should renounce religion, in order to be emancipated as a citizen. On the other hand, he considers, and this follows logically, that the political abolition of religion is the abolition of all religion. The state whic presupposes religion is not yet a true or actual state. ""Clearly, the religious idea gives some assurances to the state. But to what state? To what kind of state?""9  \xa0\xa0\xa0At this point we see that the Jewish question is considered only from one aspect.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It was by no means sufficient to ask : who should emancipate? who should be emancipated? The critic should ask a third question: what kind of emancipation is involved? What are the essential conditions of the emancipation which is demanded? The criticism of political emancipation itself was only the final criticism of the Jewish question and its genuine resolution into the ""general question of the age.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0Bauer, since he does not formulate the problem at this level, falls into contradictions. He establishes conditions which are not based upon the nature of political emancipation. He raises questions which are irrelevant to his problem, and he resolves problems which leave his question unanswered. When Bauer says of the opponents of Jewish emancipation that ""Their error was simply to assume that the Christian state was the only true one, and not to subject it to the same criticism as Judaism,""1 we see his own error in the fact that he subjects only the ""Christian state,"" and not the ""state as such"" to criticism, that he does not examine the relation between political emancipation and human emancipation, and that he, therefore, poses conditions which are only explicable by his lack of critical sense in confusing political emancipation and universal human emancipation. Bauer asks the Jews : Have you, from your standpoint, the right to demand political emancipation?.We ask the converse question: from the standpoint of political emancipation can the Jew be required to abolish Judaism, or man be asked to abolish religion?  \xa0\xa0\xa0The Jewish question presents itself differently according to the state in which the Jew resides. In Germany, where there is no political state, no state as such, the Jewish question is purely theological. The Jew finds himself in religious opposition to the state, which proclaims Christianity as its foundation. This state is a theologian ex professo. Criticism here is criticism of theology; a double-edged criticism, of Christian and of Jewish theology. And so we move always in the domain of theology, however critically we may move therein.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In France, which is a constitutional state, the Jewish question is a question of constitutionalism, of the incompleteness of political emancipation. Since the semblance of a state religion is maintained here, if only in the insignificant and self-contradictory formula of a religion of the majority, the relation of the Jews to the state also retains a semblance of religious, theological opposition.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is only in the free states of North America, or at least in some of them, that the Jewish question loses its theological significance and becomes a truly secular question. Only where the state exists in its completely developed form can the relation of the Jew, and of the religious man in general, to the political state appear in a pure form, with its own characteristics. The criticism of this relation ceases to be theological criticism when the state ceases to maintain a theological attitude towards religion, that is, when it adopts the attitude of a state, i .e. a political attitude. Criticism then becomes criticism of the political state. And at this point, where the question ceases to be theological, Bauer\'s criticism ceases to be critical.  \xa0\xa0\xa0""There is not, in the United States, either a state religion or a religion declared to be that of a majority, or a predominance of one religion over another. The state remains aloof from all religions.""2 There are even some states in North America in which ""the constitution does not impose any religious belief or practice as a condition of political rights.""3 And yet, ""no one in the United States believes that a man without religion can be an honest man.""4 And North America is pre-eminently the country of religiosity, as Beaumont,""5 Tocqueville6 and the Englishman, Hami1ton,7 assure us in unison. However, the states of North America only serve as an example. The question is : what is the relation between complete political emancipation and religion? If we find in the country which has attained full political emancipation, that religion not only continues to exist but is fresh and vigorous, this is proof that the existence of religion is not at all opposed to the perfection of the state. But since the existence of religion is the existence of a defect, the source of this defect must be sought in the nature of the state itself. Religion no longer appears as the basis, but as the manifestation of secular narrowness. That is why we explain the religious constraints upon the free citizens by the secular constraints upon them. We do not claim that they must transcend their religious narrowness in order to get rid of their secular limitations. We claim that they will transcend their religious narrowness once they have overcome their secular limitations. We do not turn secular questions into theological questions; we turn theological questions into secular ones. History has for long enough been resolved into superstition; but we now resolve superstition into history. The question of the relation between political emancipation and religion becomes for us a question of the relation between political emancipation and human emancipation. We criticize the religious failings of the political state by criticizing the political state in its secular form, disregarding its religious failings. We express in human terms the contradiction between the state and a particular religion, for example Judaism, by showing the contradiction between the state and particular secular elements, between the state and religion in general and between the state and its general presuppositions.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The political emancipation of the Jew or the Christian-of the religious man in general-is the emancipation of the state from Judaism, Christianity, and religion in general. The state emancipates itself from religion in its own particular way, in the mode which corresponds to its nature, by emancipating itself from the state religion; that is to say, by giving recognition to no religion and affirming itself purely and simply as a state. To be politically emancipated from religion is not to be finally and completely emancipated from religion, because political emancipation is not the final and absolute form of human emancipation.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The limits of political emancipation appear at once in the fact that the state can liberate itself from a constraint without man himself being really liberated; that a state may be a free state with-\xad out man himself being a free man. Bauer himself tacitly admits this when he makes political emancipation depend upon the following condition.  \xa0\xa0\xa0""It would be necessary, moreover, to abolish all religious privileges, including the monopoly of a privileged church. If some people, or even the immense majority, still felt obliged to fulfil- their religious duties, this practice should be left to them as a completely private matter."" Thus the state may have emancipated itself from religion, even though the immense majority of people continue to be religious . And the immense majority do not cease to be religious by virtue of being religious in private.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The attitude of the state, especially the free state, towards religion is only the attitude towards religion of the individuals who compose the state. It follows that man frees himself from a constraint in a political way, through the state, when he transcends his limitations, in contradiction with himself, and in an abstract, narrow and partial way. Furthermore, by emancipating himself politically, man emancipates himself in a devious way, through an intermediary, however necessary this intermediary may be. Finally, even when he proclaims himself an atheist through the intermediary of the state, that is, when he declares the state to be an atheist, he is still engrossed in religion, because he only recognizes himself as an atheist in a roundabout way, through an intermediary. Religion is simply the recognition of man in a roundabout fashion; that is, through an intermediary. The state is the intermediary between man and human liberty. Just as Christ is the intermediary to whom man attributes all his own divinity and all his religious bonds, so the state is the intermediary to which man confides all his nondivinity and all his human freedom.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The political elevation of man above religion shares the weaknesses and merits of all such political measures . For example, the state as a state abolishes private property (i .e. man decrees by political means the abolition of private property) when it abolishes the property qualification for electors and representatives, as has been done in many of the North American States. Hamilton interprets this phenomenon quite correctly from the political standpoint : The masses have gained a victory over property owners and financial wealth.8 Is not private property ideally abolished when the non- owner comes to legislate for the owner of property? The property qualification is the last political form in which private property is recognized.  \xa0\xa0\xa0But the political suppression of private property not only does not abolish private property; it actually presupposes its existence. The state abolishes, after its fashion, the distinctions established by birth, social rank, education, occupation, when it decrees that birth, social rank, education, occupation are non-political distinctions; when it proclaims, without regard to these distinctions, that every member of society is an equal partner in popular sovereignty, and treats all the elements which compose the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state. But the state, none the less, allows private property, education, occupation, to act after their own fashion, namely as private property, education, occupation, and to manifest their particular nature. Far from abolishing these effective differences, it only exists so far as they are presupposed; it is conscious of being a political state and it manifests its universality only in opposition to these elements. Hegel, therefore, defines the relation of the political state to religion quite correctly when he says: ""In order for the state to come in to existence as the selfknowing ethical actuality of spirit, it is essential that it should be distinct from the forms of authority and of faith. But this distinction emerges only in so far as divisions occur within the ecclesiastical sphere itself. It is only in this way that the state, above the particular churches, has attained to the universality of thought-its formal principle-and is bringing this universality into existence.""9 To be sure! Only in this manner, above the particular elements, can the state constitute itself as universality.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The perfected political state is, by its nature, the species-life l of man as opposed to his material life. All the presuppositions of this egoistic life continue to exist in civil society outside the political sphere, as qualities of civil society. Where the political state has attained to its full development, man leads, not only in thought, in consciousness, but in reality, in life, a double existence-celestial and terrestrial. He lives in the political community, where he regards himself as a communal being, and in civil society where he acts simply as a private individual, treats other men as means, degrades himself to the role of a mere means, and becomes the plaything of alien powers . The political state, in relation to civil society, is just as spiritual as is heaven in relation to earth. It stands in the same opposition to civil society, and overcomes it in the same manner as religion overcomes the narrowness of the profane world; i .e. it has always to acknowledge it again, re-establish it, and allow itself to be dominated by it. Man, in his most intimate reality, in civil society, is a profane being. Here, where he appears both to himself and to others as a real individual he is an illusory phenomenon. In the state, on the contrary, where he is regarded as a species-being,2 man is the imaginary member of an imaginary sovereignty, divested of his real, individual life, and infused with an unreal universality.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The conflict in which the individual, as the professor of a particular religion, finds himself involved with his own quality of citizenship and with other men as members of the community, may be resolved into the secular schism between the political state and civil society. For man as a bourgeois 3 ""life in the state is only an appearance or a fleeting exception to the normal and essential."" It is true that the bourgeois, like the Jew, participates in political life only in a sophistical way, just as the citoyen4 is a Jew or a bourgeois only in a sophistical way. But this sophistry is not personal. It is the sophistry of the political state itself. The difference between the religious man and the citizen is the same as that between the shopkeeper and the citizens, between the day-labourer and the citizen, between the landed proprietor and the citizen, between the living individual and the citizen. The contradiction in which the religious man finds himself with the political man, is the same contradiction in which the bourgeois finds himself with the citizen, and the member of civil society with his political lion\'s skin.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This secular opposition, to which the Jewish question reduces itself-the relation between the political state and its presuppositions, whether the latter are material elements such as private property, etc., or spiritual elements such as culture or religion, the conflict between the general interest and private interest, the schism between the political state and civil society-these profane contradictions, Bauer leaves intact, while he directs his polemic against their religious expression. ""It is precisely this basis-that is, the needs which assure the existence of civil society and guarantee its necessity -which exposes its existence to continual danger, maintains an element of uncertainty in civil society, produces this continually changing compound of wealth and poverty, of prosperity and distress, and above all generates change.""5 Compare the whole section entitled ""Civil society,""6 which follows closely the distinctive features of Hegel\'s philosophy of right. Civil society, in its opposition to this political state, is recognized as necessary because the political state is recognized as necessary.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Political emancipation certainly represents a great progress. It is not, indeed, the final form of human emancipation, but it is the final form of human emancipation within the framework of the prevailing social order. It goes without saying that we are speaking here of real, practical emancipation.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Man emancipates himself politically from religion by expelling it from the sphere of public law to that of private law. Religion is no longer the spirit of the state, in which man behaves, albeit in a specific and limited way and in a particular sphere, as a species-being, in community with other men. It has become the spirit of civil society, of the sphere of egoism and of the bellum omnium contraomnes. It is no longer the essence of community, but the essence of differentiation. It has become what it was at the beginning, an expression of the fact that man is separated from the community, from himself and from other men. It is now only the abstract avowal of an individual folly, a private whim or caprice. The infinite fragmentation of religion in North America, for example; already gives it the external form of a strictly private affair. It has been relegated among the numerous private interests and exiled from the life of the community as such. But one should have no illusions about the scope of political emancipation. The division of man into the public person and the private person, the displacement of religion from the state to civil society-all this is not a stage in political emancipation but its consummation. Thus political emancipation does not abolish, and does not even strive to abolish, man\'s real religiosity.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The decomposition of man into Jew and citizen, Protestant and citizen, religious man and citizen, is not a deception practiced against the political system nor yet an evasion of political emancipation. It is political emancipation itself, the political mode of emancipation from religion. Certainly, in periods when the political state as such comes violently to birth in civil society, and when men strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, the state can, and must, proceed to abolish and destroy religion; but only in the same way as it proceeds to abolish private property, by declaring a maximum, by confiscation, or by progressive taxation, or in the same way as it proceeds to abolish life, by the guillotine. At those times when the state is most aware of itself, political life seeks to stifle its own prerequisites-civil society and its elements-and to establish itself as the genuine and harmonious species-life of man. But it can only achieve this end by setting itself in violent contradiction with its own conditions of existence, by declaring a permanent revolution. Thus the political drama ends necessarily with the restoration of religion, of private property, of all the elements of civil society, just as war ends with the conclusion of peace.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In fact, the perfected Christian state is not the so-called Christian state which acknowledges Christianity as its basis, as the state religion, and thus adopts an exclusive attitude towards other religions; it is, rather, the atheistic state, the democratic state, the state which relegates religion among the other elements of civil society. The state which is still theological, which still professes officially the Christian creed, and which has not yet dared to declare itself a state, has not yet succeeded in expressing in a human and secular form, in its political reality, the human basis of which Christianity is the transcendental expression. The so-called Christian state is simply a non-state; since it is not Christianity as a religion, but only the human core of the Christian religion which can realize itself in truly human creations.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The so-called Christian state is the Christian negation of the state, but not at all the political realization of Christianity. The state which professes Christianity as a religion does not yet profess it in a political form, because it still has a religious attitude towards religion. In other words, such a state is not the genuine realization of the human basis of religion, because it still accepts the unreal, imaginary form of this human core. The so-called Christian state is an imperfect state, for which the Christian religion serves as the supplement and sanctification of its imperfection. Thus religion becomes necessarily one of its means; and so it is the hypocritical state. There is a great difference between saying: (i) that the perfect state, owing to a deficiency in the general nature of the state, counts religion as one of its prerequisites, or ( ii) that the imperfect state, owing to a deficiency in its particular existence as an imperfect state, declares that religion is its basis. In the latter, religion becomes imperfect politics. In the former, the imperfection even of perfected politics is revealed in religion. The so-called Christian state needs the Christian religion in order to complete itself as a state. The democratic state, the real state, does not need religion for its political consummation. On the contrary, it can dispense with religion, because in this case the human core of religion is realized in a profane manner. The so-called Christian state, on the other hand, has a political attitude towards religion, and a religious attitude towards politics. It reduces political institutions and religion equally to mere appearances.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In order to make this contradiction clearer we shall examine Bauer\'s model of the Christian state, a model which is derived from his study of the German-Christian state.  \xa0\xa0\xa0""Quite recently,"" says Bauer, ""in order to demonstrate the impossibility or the non-existence of a Christian state, those pas-\xad sages in the Bible have been frequently quoted with which the state does not conform and cannot conform unless it wishes to dissolve itself entirely.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0""But the question is not so easily settled. What do these Biblical passages demand? Supernatural renunciation, submission to the authority of revelation, turning away from the state, the abolition of profane conditions. But the Christian state proclaims and accomplishes all these things. It has assimilated the spirit of the Bible, and if it does not reproduce it exactly in the terms which the Bible uses, that is simply because it expresses this spirit in political forms, in forms which are borrowed from the political system of this world but which, in the religious rebirth which they are obliged to undergo, are reduced to simple appearances. Man turns away from the state and by this means realizes and completes the political institutions .""7  \xa0\xa0\xa0Bauer continues by showing that the members of a Christian state no longer constitute a nation with a will of its own. The nation has its true existence in the leader to whom it is subjected; but this leader is, by his origin and nature, alien to it since he has been imposed by God without the people having any part in the matter. The laws of such a nation are not its own work, but are direct revelations . The supreme leader, in his relations with the real nation, the masses, requires privileged intermediaries; and the nation itself disintegrates into a multitude of distinct spheres which are formed and determined by chance, are differentiated from each other by their interests and their specific passions and prejudices, and acquire as a privilege the permission to isolate themselves from each other, etc.8  \xa0\xa0\xa0But Bauer himself says : ""Politics, if it is to be nothing more than religion, should not be politics; any more than the scouring of pans, if it is treated as a religious matter, should be regarded as ordinary housekeeping.""9 But in the German-Christian state religion is an ""economic matter"" just as ""economic matters"" are religion. In the German-Christian state the power of religion is the religion of power.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The separation of the ""spirit of the Bible"" from the ""letter of the Bible"" is an irreligious act. The state which expresses the Bible in the letter of politics, or in any letter other than that of the Holy Ghost, commits sacrilege, if not in the eyes of men at least in the eyes of its own religion. The state which acknowledges the Bible as its charter and Christianity as its supreme rule must be assessed according to the words of the Bible; for even the language of the Bible is sacred. Such a state, as well as the human rubbish upon which it is based, finds itself involved in a painful contradiction, which is insoluble from the standpoint of religious consciousness, when it is referred to those words of the Bible ""with which it does not conform and cannot conform unless it wishes to dissolve itself entirely."" And why does it not wish to dissolve itself entirely? The state itself cannot answer either itself or others. In its own consciousness the official Christian state is an ""ought"" whose realization is imposible. It cannot affirm the reality of its own existence without lying to itself, and so it remains always in its own eyes an object of doubt, an uncertain and problematic object. Criticism is, therefore, entirely within its rights in forcing the state, which supports itself upon the Bible, into a total disorder of thought in which it no longer knows whether it is illusion or reality; and  in which the infamy of its profane ends ( for which religion serves as a cloak) enter into an insoluble conflict with the probity of its religious consciousness ( for which religion appears as the goal of the world ). Such a state can only escape its inner torment by becoming the myrmidon of the Catholic Church. In the face of this Church, which asserts that secular power is entirely subordinate to its commands, the state is powerless; powerless the secular power which claims to be the rule of the religious spirit.  \xa0\xa0\xa0What prevails in the so-called Christian state is not man but alienation. The only man who counts-the King-is specifically differentiated from other men and is still a religious being associated directly with heaven and with God. The relations which exist here are relations still based upon faith. The religious spirit is still not really secularized.  \xa0\xa0\xa0But the religious spirit cannot be really secularized. For what is it but the non-secular form of a stage in the development of the human spirit? The religious spirit can only be realized if the stage of development of the human spirit which it expresses in religious form, manifests and constitutes itself in its secular form. This is what happens in the democratic state. The basis of this state is not Christianity but the human basis of Christianity. Religion remains the ideal, non-secular consciousness of its members, because it is the ideal form of the stage of human development which has been attained.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The members of the political state are religious because of the dualism between individual life and species-life, between the life of civil society and political life. They are religious in the sense that man treats political life, which is remote from his own individual existence, as if it were his true life; and in the sense that religion is here the spirit of civil society, and expresses the separation and withdrawal of man from man. Political democracy is Christian in the sense that man, not merely one man but every man, is there considered a sovereign being, a supreme being; but it is uneducated, unsocial man, man just as he is in his fortuitous existence, man as he has been corrupted, lost to himself, alienated, subjected to the rule of inhuman conditions and elements, by the whole organization of our society-in short man who is not yet a real species-being. Creations of fantasy, dreams, the postulates of Christianity, the sovereignty of man-but of man as an alien being distinguished from the real man-all these become, in democracy, the tangible and present reality, secular maxims.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In the perfected democracy, the religious and theological consciousness appears to itself all the more religious and theological in that it is apparently without any political significance or terrestrial aims, is an affair of the heart withdrawn from the world, an expression of the limitations of reason, a product of arbitrariness and fantasy, a veritable life in the beyond. Christianity here attains the practical expression of its universal religious significance, because the most varied views are brought together in the form of Christianity, and still more because Christianity does not ask that anyone should profess Christianity, but simply that he should have some kind of religion (see Beaumont, op. cit.) . The religious consciousness runs riot in a wealth of contradictions and diversity.  \xa0\xa0\xa0We have shown, therefore, that political emancipation from religion leaves religion in existence, although this is no longer a privileged religion. The contradiction in which the adherent of a particular religion finds himself in relation to his citizenship is only one aspect of the universal secular contradiction between the political state and  civil society. The consummation of the Christian state is a state which acknowledges itself simply as a state and ignores the religion of its members. The emancipation of the state from religion is not the emancipation of the real man from religion.  \xa0\xa0\xa0We do not say to the Jews, therefore, as does Bauer: you cannot be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves completely from Judaism. We say rather: it is because you can be emancipated politically, without renouncing Judaism completely and absolutely, that political emancipation itself is not human emancipation. If you want to be politically emancipated, without emancipating yourselves humanly, the inadequacy and the contradiction is not entirely in yourselves but in the nature and the category of political emancipation. If you are preoccupied with this category you share the general prejudice. Just as the state evangelizes when, although it is a state, it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews, the Jew acts politically when, though a Jew, he demands civil rights.  \xa0\xa0\xa0But if a man, though a Jew, can be emancipated politically and acquire civil rights, can he claim and acquire what are called the rights of man? Bauer denies it. ""The question is whether the Jew as such, that is, the Jew who himself avows that he is constrained by his true nature to live eternally separate from men, is able to acquire and to concede to others the universal rights of man.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0""The idea of the rights of man was only discovered in the Christian world, in the last century. It is not an innate idea; on the contrary, \'it is acquired in a struggle against the historical traditions in which man has been educated up to the present time. The rights of man are not, therefore, a gift of nature, nor a legacy from past history, but the reward of a struggle against the accident of birth and against the privileges which history has hitherto transmitted from generation to generation. They are the results of culture, and only he can possess them who has merited and earned them.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0""But can the Jew really take possession of them? As long as he remains Jewish the limited nature which makes him a Jew must prevail over the human nature which should associate him, as a man, with other men; and it will isolate him from everyone who is not a Jew. He declares, by this separation, that the particular nature which makes him Jewish is his true and supreme nature, before which human nature has to efface itself.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0""Similarly, the Christian as such cannot grant the rights of man.""1  \xa0\xa0\xa0According to Bauer man has to sacrifice the ""privilege of faith"" in order to acquire the general rights of man. Let us consider for a moment the so-called rights of man; let us examine them in their most authentic form, that which they have among those who discovered them, the North Americans and the French! These rights of man are, in part, political rights, which can only be exercised if one is a member of a community. Their content is participation in the community life, in the political life of the community, the life of the state. They fall in the category of political liberty, of civil rights, which as we have seen do not at all presuppose the consistent and positive abolition of religion; nor consequently, of Judaism. It remains to consider the other part, namely the rights of man as distinct from the rights of the citizen.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Among them is to be found the freedom of conscience, the right to practise a chosen religion. The privilege of faith is expressly recognized, either as a right of man or as a consequence of a right of man, namely liberty. Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, 1791, Article 10: ""No one is to be disturbed on account of his opinions, even religious opinions."" There is guaranteed, as one of the rights of man, ""the liberty of every man to practise the religion to which he adheres.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0The Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc. 1793, enumerates among the rights of man (Article 7 ) : ""The liberty of religious observance."" Moreover, it is even stated, with respect to the right to express ideas and opinions, to hold meetings, to practise a religion, that: ""The necessity of enunciating these rights presupposes either the existence or the recent memory of despotism."" Compare the Constitution of 1795, Section XII, Article 354.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Constitution of Pennsylvania, Article 9, 3: ""All men have received from nature the imprescriptible right to worship the Almighty according to the dictates of their conscience, and no one can be legally compelled to follow, establish or support against his will any religion or religious ministry. No human authority can, in any circumstances, intervene in a matter of conscience or control the forces of the soul.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0Constitution of New Hampshire, Articles 5 and 6: ""Among these natural rights some are by nature inalienable since nothing can replace them. The rights of conscience are among them.""2  \xa0\xa0\xa0The incompatibility between religion and the rights of man is so little manifest in the concept of the rights of man that the right to be religious, in one\'s own fashion, and to practise one\'s own particular religion, is expressly included among the rights of man. The privilege of faith is a universal right of man.  \xa0\xa0\xa0A distinction is made between the rights of man and the rights of the citizen. Who is this man distinct from the citizen? No one but the member of civil society. Why is the member of civil society called ""man,"" simply man, and why are his rights called the ""rights of man""? How is this fact to be explained? By the relation between the political state and civil society, and by the nature of political emancipation.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Let us notice first of all that the so-called rights of man, as distinct from the rights of the citizen, are simply the rights of a member of civil society, that is, of egoistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community. The most radical constitution, that of 1 793, says : Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen: Article 2. ""These righ ts, etc. ( the natural and imprescriptible rights ) are : equality, liberty,security, property.  \xa0\xa0\xa0What constitutes liberty?  \xa0\xa0\xa0Article 6. ""Liberty is the power which man has to do everything which does not harm the rights of others . ""  \xa0\xa0\xa0Liberty is, therefore, the right to do everything which does not harm others. The limits within which each individual can act with\xad out harming others are determined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is marked by a stake. It is a question of the liberty of man regarded as an isolated monad, withdrawn into himself. Why, according to Bauer, is the Jew not fitted to acquire the rights of man? ""As long as he remains Jewish the limited nature which makes him a Jew must prevail over the human nature which should associate him, as a man, with other men; and it will isolate him from everyone who is not a Jew."" But liberty as a right of man is not founded upon the relations between man and man, but rather upon the separation. of man from man. It is the right of such separation. The right of the circumscribed individual, withdrawn into himself.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The practical application of the right of liberty is the right of private property. What constitutes the right of private property?  \xa0\xa0\xa0Article 16 ( Constitution of 1793 ) ""The right of property is that which belongs to every citizen of enjoying and disposing as he will of his goods and revenues, of the fruits of his work and industry . ""  \xa0\xa0\xa0The right of property is, therefore, the right to enjoy one\'s fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society. It is the right of self-interest. This individual liberty, and its application, form the basis of civil society. It leads every man to see in other men, not the realization, but rather the limitation of his own liberty. It declares above all the right ""to enjoy and to dispose as one will, one\'s goods and revenues, the fruits of one\'s work and industry.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0There remain the other rights of man, equality and security.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The term ""equality"" has here no political significance. It is only the equal right to liberty as defined above; namely that every man is equally regarded as a self-sufficient monad. The Constitution of 1795, defines the concept of liberty in this sense.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Article 5 ( Constitution of 1 795 ) \' ""Equality consists in the fact that the law is the same for all, whether it protects or punishes .""  \xa0\xa0\xa0And security?  \xa0\xa0\xa0Article 8 (Constitution of 1793) ""Security consists in the protection afforded by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person, his rights, and his property.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0Security is the supreme social concept of civil society; the concept of the police. The whole society exists only in order to guarantee for each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property. It is in this sense that Hegel calls civil society ""the state of need and of reason.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0The concept of security is not enough to raise civil society above its egoism. Security is, rather, the assurance of its egoism.  \xa0\xa0\xa0None of the supposed rights of man, therefore, go beyond the egoistic man, man as he is, as a member of civil society; that is, an individual separated from the community, withdrawn into himself, wholly preoccupied with his private interest and acting in accordance with his private caprice. Man is far from being considered, in the rights of man, as a species-being; on the contrary, species-life itself-society-appears as a system which is external to the individual and as a limitation of his original independence. The only bond between men is natural necessity, need and private interest, the presentation of their property and their egoistic persons.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is difficult enough to understand that a nation which has just begun to liberate itself, to tear down all the barriers between different sections of the people and to establish a political community, should solemnly proclaim (Declaration of 1791) the rights of the egoistic man, separated from his fellow men and from the community, and should renew this proclamation at a moment when only the most heroic devotion can save the nation ( and is, therefore, urgently called for ), and when the sacrifice of all the interests of civil society is in question and egoism should be punished as a crime. (Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc. 1793 ). The matter becomes still more incomprehensible when we observe that the political liberators reduce citizenship, the political community, to a mere means for preserving these so-called rights of man; and consequently, that the citizen is declared to be the servant of egoistic ""man,"" that the sphere in which man functions as a species-being is degraded to a level below the sphere where he functions as a partial being, and finally that it is man as a bourgeois and not man as a citizen who is considered the true and authentic man.  \xa0\xa0\xa0""The end of every political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man."" ( Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc. 1791, Article 2.) ""Government is instituted in order to guarantee man\'s enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights."" (Declaration, etc. 1793, Article 1 .) Thus, even in the period of its youthful enthusiasm, which is raised to fever pitch by the force of circumstances, political life declares itself to be only a means, whose end is the life of civil society. It is true that its revo\xad lutionary practice is in flagrant contradiction with its theory. While, for instance, security is declared to be one of the rights of man, the violation of the privacy of correspondence is openly considered. W,hile the ""unlimited freedom of the Press"" ( Constitution of 1793, Article 122 ) , as a corollary of the right of individual liberty, is guaranteed, the freedom of the Press is completely destroyed, since ""the freedom of the Press should not be permitted when it endangers public liberty.""3 This amounts to saying: the right to liberty ceases to be a right as soon as it comes into conflict with political life, whereas in theory political life is no more than the guarantee of the rights of man-the rights of the individual man-and should, therefore, be suspended as soon as it comes into contradiction with its end, these rights of man. But practice is only the exception, while theory is the rule. Even if one decided to regard revolutionary practice as the correct expression of this rela\xad tion, the problem would remain as to why it is that in the minds of political liberators the relation is inverted, so that the end appears as the means and the means as the end? This optical illusion of their consciousness would always remain a problem, though a psy\xad chological and theoretical one.  \xa0\xa0\xa0But the problem is easily solved.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Political emancipation is at the same time the dissolution of the old society, upon which the sovereign power, the alienated political life of the people, rests. Political revolution is a revolution of civil society. What was the nature of the old society? It can be characterized in one word: feudalism. The old civil society had a directly political character; that is, the elements of civil life such as property, the family, and types of occupation had been raised, in the form of lordship, caste and guilds, to elements of political life. They determined, in this form, the relation of the individual to the state as a whole; that is, his political situation, or in other words, his separation and exclusion from the other elements of society. For this organization of national life did not constitute property and labour as social elements; it rather succeeded in separating them from the body of the state, and made them distinct societies within society. Nevertheless, at least in the feudal sense, the vital func\xad tions and conditions of civil society remained political. They excluded the individual from the body of the state, and trans\xad formed the particular relation which existed between his corpora- tion and the state into a general relation between the individual and social life, j ust as they transformed his specific civil activity and situation into a general activity and situation. As a result of this organization, the state as a whole and its consciousness, will and activity-the general political power-also necessarily appeared as the private affair of a ruler and his servants, separated from the people.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The political revolution which overthrew this power of the ruler, which made state affairs the affairs of the people, and the political state a matter of general concern, i.e. a real state, necessarily shattered everything-estates, corporations, guilds, privileges-which expressed the separation of the people from community life. The political revolution therefore abolished the political character of civil society. It dissolved civil society into its basic elements, on the one hand individuals, and on the other hand the material and cultural elements which formed the life experience and the civil situation of these individuals. It set free the political spirit which had, so to speak, been dissolved, fragmented and lost in the various culs-de-sac of feudal society; it reassembled these scattered frag\xad ments, liberated the political spirit from its connexion with civil life and made of it the community sphere, the general concern of the people, in principle independent of these particular elements of civil life. A specific activity and situation in life no longer had any but an individual significance. They no longer constituted the general relation between the individual and the state as a whole. Public affairs as such became the general affair of each individual, and political functions became general functions.  \xa0\xa0\xa0But the consummation of the idealism of the state was at the same time the consummation of the materialism of civil society. The bonds which had restrained the egoistic spirit of civil society were removed along with the political yoke. Political emancipation was at the same time an emancipation of civil society from politics and from even the semblance of a general content.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Feudal society was dissolved into its basic element, man; but into egoistic man who was its real foundation.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Man in this aspect, the member of civil society, is now the foundation and presupposition of the political state. He is recognized as such in the rights of man.  \xa0\xa0\xa0But the liberty of egoistic man, and the recognition of this liberty, is rather the recognition of the frenzied movement of the cul-\xad tural and material elements which form the content of his life.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Thus man was not liberated from religion; he received religious liberty. He was not liberated from property; he received the liberty to own property. He was not liberated from the egoism of business; he received the liberty to engage in business.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The formation of the political state, and the dissolution of civil society into independent individuals whose relations are regulated by law, as the relations between men in the corporations and guilds were regulated by privilege, are accomplished by one and the same act. Man as a member of civil society-non-political man\xadnecessarily appears as the natural man. The rights of man appear as natural rights because conscious activity is concentrated upon political action. Egoistic man is the passive, given result of the dissolution of society, an object of direct apprehension and consequently a natural object. The political revolution dissolves civil society into its elements without revolutionizing these elements themselves or subjecting them to criticism. This revolution regards civil society, the sphere of human needs, labour, private interests and civil law, as the basis of its own existence, as a self-subsistent precondition, and thus as its natural basis. Finally, man as a member of civil society is identified with authentic man, man as distinct from citizen, because he is man in his sensuous, individual and immediate existence, whereas political man is only abstract, artificial man, man as an allegorical, moral person. Thus man as he really is, is seen only in the form of egoistic man, and man in his true nature only in the form of the abstract citizen.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The abstract notion of political man is well formulated by Rousseau: ""Whoever dares undertake to establish a people\'s institutions must feel himself capable of changing, as it were, human nature itself, of transforming each individual who, in isolation, is a complete but solitary whole, into a part of something greater than himself, from which in a sense, he derives his life and his being;  of substituting a limited and moral existence for the physical and independent life . His task, in short, is to take from a man his own powers, and to give him in exchange alien powers which he can only employ with the help of other men.""4  \xa0\xa0\xa0Every emancipation is a restoration of the human world and of human relationships to man himself.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Political emancipation is a reduction of man, on the one hand to a member of civil society, an independent and egoistic individual, and on the other hand, to a citizen, to a moral person.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Human emancipation will only be complete when the real, individual man has absorbed into himself the abstract citizen; when as an individual man, in his everyday life, in his work, and in his relationships, he has become a species-being; and when he has recognized and organized his own powers (forces propres) as social powers so that he no longer separates this social power from himself as political power.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 2. Bruno Bauer, ""Die Fahigkeit der heutigen  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Juden und Christen frei zu werden""5  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is in this form that Bauer studies the relation between the Jewish and Christian religions, and also their relation with modern criticism. This latter relation is their relation with ""the capacity to become free.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0He reaches this conclusion: ""The Christian has only to raise himself one degree, to rise above his religion, in order to abolish religion in general,"" and thus to become free; but ""the Jew, on the contrary, has to break not only with his Jewish nature, but also with the process towards the consummation of his religion, a proc-\xad ess which has remained alien to him.""6  \xa0\xa0\xa0Thus Bauer here transforms the question of Jewish emancipation into a purely religious question. The theological doubt about whether the Jew or the Christian has the better chance of attaining salvation is reproduced here in the more enlightened form : which of the two is more capable of emancipation? It is indeed no longer asked: which makes free-Judaism or Christianity? On the contrary, it is now asked: which makes free-the negation of Judaism or the negation of Christianity?  \xa0\xa0\xa0""If they wish to become free the Jews should not embrace Christianity as such, but Christianity in dissolution, religion in dissolution; that is to say, the Enlightenment, criticism, and its outcome, a free humanity.""7  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is still a matter, therefore, of the Jews professing some kind of faith; no longer Christianity as such, but Christianity in dissolution.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Bauer asks the Jews to break with the essence of the Christian religion, but this demand does not follow, as he himself admits, from the development of the Jewish nature.  \xa0\xa0\xa0From the moment when Bauer, at the end of his Judenfrage, saw in Judaism only a crude religious criticism of Christianity, and; therefore, attributed to it only a religious significance, it was to b.e expected that he would transform the emancipation of the Jews into a philosophico-theological act.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Bauer regards the ideal and abstract essence of the Jew-his religion-as the whole of his nature. He, therefore, concludes rightly that ""The Jew contributes nothing to mankind when he disregards his own limited law,"" when he renounces all his Judaism.8  \xa0\xa0\xa0The relation between Jews and Christians thus becomes the following: the only interest which the emancipation of the Jew presents for the Christian is a general human and theoretical interest. Judaism is a phenomenon which offends the religious eye of the Christian. As soon as the Christian\'s eye ceases to be religious the phenomenon ceases to offend it. The emancipation of the Jew is not in itself, therefore, a task which falls to the Christian to per- form.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The Jew, on the other hand, if he wants to emancipate himself has to undertake, besides his own work, the work of the Christian-the ""criticism of the gospels,"" of the ""life of Jesus,"" etc.9 ""It is for them to arrange matters; they will decide their own destiny. But history does not allow itself to be mocked.""l  \xa0\xa0\xa0We will attempt to escape from the theological formulation of the question. For us, the question concerning the capacity of thc Jew for emancipation is transformed into another question: what specific social element is it necessary to overcome in order to abolish Judaism? For the capacity of the present-day Jew to emancipate himself expresses the relation of Judaism to the emancipation of the contemporary world. The relation results necessarily from the particular situation of Judaism in the present enslaved world.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Let us consider the real Jew: not the sabbath Jew, whom Bauer considers, but the everyday Jew.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Let us not seek the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us seek the secret of the religion in the real Jew.  \xa0\xa0\xa0What is the profane basis of Judaism? Practical need, self\xad interest. What is the worldly cult of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly god? Money.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Very well: then in emancipating itself from huckstering and money, and thus from real and practical Judaism, our age would emancipate itself.  \xa0\xa0\xa0An organization of society which would abolish the preconditions and thus the very possibility of huckstering, would make the Jew impossible. His religious consciousness would evaporate like some insipid vapour in the real, life-giving air of society. On the other hand, when the Jew recognizes his practical nature as invalid and endeavours to abolish it, he begins to deviate from his former path of development, works for general human emancipation and turns against the supreme practical expression of human self\xad estrangement.  \xa0\xa0\xa0We discern in Judaism, therefore, a universal antisocial element of the present time, whose historical development, zealously aided in its harmful aspects by the Jews, has now attained its culminating point, a point at which it must necessarily begin to disintegrate. In the final analysis, the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The Jew has already emancipated himself in a Jewish fashion.  \xa0\xa0\xa0""The Jew, who is merely tolerated in Vienna for example, determines the fate of the whole Empire by his financial power. The Jew, who may be entirely without rights in the smallest German state, decides the destiny of Europe. While the corporations and guilds exclude the Jew, or at least look on him with disfavour, the audacity of industry mocks the obstinacy of medieval institutions.""2  \xa0\xa0\xa0This is not an isolated instance. The Jew has emancipated him\xad self in a Jewish manner, not only by acquiring the power of money, but also because money has become, through him and also apart from him, a world power, while the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The Jews have emancipated themselves in so far as the Christians have become Jews.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Thus, for example, Captain Hamilton reports that the devout and politically free inhabitant of New England is a kind of Laocoon who makes not the least effort to escape from the serpents which are crushing him. Mammon is his idol which he adores not only with his lips but with the whole force of his body and mind. In his view the world is no more than a Stock Exchange, and he is convinced that he has no other destiny here below than to become richer than his neighbour. Trade has seized upon all his thoughts, and he has no other recreation than to exchange objects. When he travels he carries, so to speak, his goods and h is counter on his back and talks only of interest and profit. If he loses sight of his own business for an instant it is only in order to pry into the business of his competitors.3  \xa0\xa0\xa0In North America, indeed, the effective domination of the Christian world by Judaism has come to be manifested in a common and unambiguous form; the preaching of the Gospel itself, Christian preaching, has become an article of commerce, and the bankrupt trader in the church behaves like the prosperous clergyman in business. ""This man whom you see at the head of a respectable congregation began as a trader; his business having failed he has become a minister. This other began as a priest, but as soon as he had accumulated some money he abandoned the priesthood for trade. In the eyes of many people the religious ministry is a veritable industrial career. ""4  \xa0\xa0\xa0According to Bauer, it is ""a hypocritical situation when, in theory, the Jew is deprived of political rights, while in practice he wields tremendous power and exercises on a wholesale scale the political influence which is denied him in minor matters .""5  \xa0\xa0\xa0The contradiction which exists between the effective political power of the Jew and his political rights, is the contradiction between politics and the power of money in general. Politics is in principle superior to the power of money, but in practice it has become its bondsman.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Judaism has maintained itself alongside Christianity, not only because it constituted the religious criticism of Christianity and embodied the doubt concerning the religious origins of Christianity, but equally because the practical Jewish spirit-Judaism or commerce6-has perpetuated itself in Christian society and has even attained its highest development there. The Jew, who occupies a distinctive place in civil society, only manifests in a distinctive way the Judaism of civil society.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Judaism has been preserved, not in spite of history, but by history.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is from its own entrails that civil society ceaselessly engenders the Jew.  \xa0\xa0\xa0What was, in itself, the basis of the Jewish religion? Practical need, egoism.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The monotheism of the Jews is, therefore, in reality, a polytheism of the numerous needs of man, a polytheism which makes even the lavatory an object of divine regulation. Practical need, egoism, is the principle of civil society, and is revealed as such in its pure form as soon as civil society has fully engendered the political state. The god of practical need and self-interest is money.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Money is the jealous god of Israel, beside which no other god may exist. Money abases all the gods of mankind and changes them into commodities. Money is the universal and self-sufficient value of all things. It has, therefore, deprived the whole world, both the human world and nature, of their own proper value. Money is the alienated essence of man\'s work and existence; this essence dominates him and he worships it.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The god of the Jews has been secularized and has become the god of this world. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The mode of perceiving nature, under the rule of private property and money, is a real contempt for, and a practical degradation of nature, which does indeed exist in the Jewish religion but only as a creature of the imagination.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is in this sense that Thomas Munzer declares it intolerable ""that every creature should be transformed into property-the fishes in the water, the birds of the air, the plants of the earth: the creature too should become free.""7  \xa0\xa0\xa0That which is contained in an abstract form in the Jewish reli\xad gion-contempt for theory, for art, for history, and for man as an end in himself-is the real, conscious standpoint and the virtue of the man of money. Even the species-relation itself, the relation between man and woman, becomes an object of commerce. Woman is bartered away.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the trader, and above all of the financier.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The law, without basis or reason, of the Jew, is only the religious caricature of morality and right in general, without basis or reason; the purely formal rites with which the world of self-interest encircles itself.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Here again the supreme condition of man is his legal status, his relationship to laws which are valid for him, not because they are the laws of his own will and nature, but because they are dominant and any infraction of them will be avenged.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Jewish Jesuitism, the same practical Jesuitism which Bauer dis\xad covers in the Talmud, is the relationship of the world of self\xad interest to the laws which govern this world, laws which the world devotes its principal arts to circumventing.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Indeed, the operation of this world within its framework of laws is impossible without the continual supersession of law. \xa0\xa0\xa0Judaism could not develop further as a religion, in a theoretical form, because the world view of practical need is, by its very nature, circumscribed, and the delineation of its characteristics soon completed.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The religion of practical need could not, by its very nature, find its consummation in theory, but only in practice, just because prac\xad tice is its truth.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Judaism could not create a new world. It could only bring the new creations and conditions af the world within its own sphere of activity, because practical need, the spirit of which is self-interest, is always passive, cannot expand at will, but finds itself extended as a result of the continued development of society.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Judaism attains its apogee with the perfection of civil society; but civil society only reaches perfection in the Christian world. Only under the sway of Christianity, which objectifies all national, natural, moral and theoretical relationships, could civil society separate itself completely from the life of the state, sever all the species\xad bonds of man, establish egoism and selfish need in their place, and dissolve the human world into a world of atomistic, antagonistic individuals.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Christianity issued from Judaism. It has now been re-absorbed into Judaism.  \xa0\xa0\xa0From the beginning, the Christian was the theorizing Jew; consequently, the Jew is the practical Christian. And the practical Christian has become a Jew again.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It was only in appearance that Christianity overcame real Judaism. It was too refinedtheoretical fashion, the alienation of man from himself and from nature.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It was only then that Judaism could attain universal domination and could turn alienated man and alienated nature into alienable, saleable objects, in thrall to egoistic need and huckstering.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Objectification is the practice of alienation. Just as man, so long as he is engrossed in religion, can only objectify his essence by an alien and fantastic being; so under the sway of egoistic need, he can only affirm himself and produce objects in practice by subordinating his products and his own activity to the domination of an alien entity, and by attributing to them the significance of an alien entity, namely money.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In its perfected. practice the spiritual egoism of Christianity nec\xad essarily becomes the material egoism of the Jew, celestial need is transmuted into terrestrial need, subjectivism into self-interest. The tenacity of the Jew is to be explained, not by his religion, but rather by the human basis of his religion-practical need and egoism.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is because the essence of the Jew was universally realized and secularized in civil society, that civil society could not convince the Jew of the unreality of his religious essence, which is precisely the ideal representation of practical need. It is not only, therdore, in the Pentateuch and the Talmud, but also in contemporary society, that we find the essence of the present-day Jew; not as an abstract essence, but as one which is supremely empirical, not only as a limitation of the Jew, but as the Jewish narrowness of society.  \xa0\xa0\xa0As soon as society succeeds in abolishing the empirical essence of Judaism-huckstering and its conditions-the Jew becomes impossible, because his consciousness no longer has an object. The subjective basis of Judaism-practical need-assumes a human form, and the conflict between the inaividual, sensuous existence of man and his species-existence, is abolished.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The social emancipation of the Jew is the emancipation of society from Judaism.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Contribution to the Critique of Hegel\'s  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Philosophy of Right: Introduction  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 KARL MARX  \xa0\xa0\xa0Written at the close of 1843 and published in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbuche in 1844, this essay is a consummate expression of the radical mind. It proclaims the need for a ""radical revolution"" as the way to man\'s self-realization. Germany is taken as the focal point of this revolution, and the proletariat-the concept of which makes its first appearance in Marx\'s writings here-as its class vehicle. In August 1844 Marx sent a copy of the essay to Ludwig Feuerbach along with a long letter expressing love and respect for that thinker, whose writing had provided, he wrote, a ""philosophical foundation for socialism"" by bringing the idea of the human species from ""the heaven of abstraction to the real earth."" Feuerbach\'s influence, along with that of Hegel, is clearly visible in the essay.  \xa0\xa0\xa0For Germany, the cristicism of religion has been largely completed; and the criticism of religion is the premise of all criticism.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The profane existence of error is compromised once its celestial oratio pro aris et focis has been refuted. Man, who has found in the fantastic reality of heaven, where he sought a supernatural being, only his own reflection, will no longer be tempted to find only the semblance of himself-a non-human being-where he seeks and must seek his true reality.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The basis of irreligious criticism is this: man makes religion; religion does not make man. Religion is indeed man\'s self\xad consciousness and self-awareness so long as he has not found him\xad self or has lost himself again. But man is not an abstract being, squatting outside the world. Man is the human world, the state. This state, this society, produce religion which is an inverted world consciousness, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopedic com\xad pendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d\'honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, its general basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human being inasmuch as the human being possesses no true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly a struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Religious suffering is at the same time an expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the sentiment of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of men, is a demand for their real happiness. The call to abandon their illusions about their condition is a call to abandon a condition which requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, the embryonic criticism of this vale of tears of which religion is the I halo.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers from the chain, not in order that man shall bear the chain without caprice or consolation but so that he shall cast off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man so that he will think, act and fashion his reality as a man who has lost his illusions and regained his reason; so that he will revolve about himself as his true sun. Religion is only the illusory sun about which man revolves so long as he does not revolve about himself.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is the task of history, therefore, once the other-world of truth has vanished, to establish the truth of this world. The immediate task of philosophy, which is in the service of history, is to unmask human self-alienation in its secular form now that it has been unmasked in its sacred form. Thus the criticism of heaven is trans-\xad formed into the criticism of earth, the criticism of religion into the criticism of law and the criticism of theology into the criticism of politics.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The following exposition1-which is a contribution to this undertaking-does not deal directly with the original but with a copy, the German philosophy of the state and of right, for the simple reason that it deals with Germany.  \xa0\xa0\xa0If one were to begin with the status quo itself in Germany, even in the most appropriate way, i .e. negatively, the result would still be an anachronism. Even the negation of our political present is already a dusty fact in the historical lumber room of modern nations. I may negate powdered wigs, but I am still left with unpowdered wigs. If I negate the German situation of 1843 I have, according to French chronology, hardly reached the year 1789, and still less the vital centre of the present day.  \xa0\xa0\xa0German history, indeed, prides itself upon a development which no other nation had previously accomplished, or will ever imitate in the historical sphere. We have shared in the restorations of modern nations without ever sharing in their revolutions . We have been restored, first because other nations have dared to make revolutions, and secondly because other nations have suffered counter\xad revolutions; in the first case because our masters were afraid, and in the second case because they were not afraid. Led by our shep\xad herds, we have only once kept company with liberty and that was on the day of its internment.  \xa0\xa0\xa0A school of thought, which justifies the infamy of today by that of yesterday, which regards every cry from the serf under the knout as a cry of rebellion once the knout has become time-honoured, ancestral and historical, a school for which history shows only its a posteriori as the God of Israel did for his servant Moses-the Historical school of law2-might be supposed to have invented German history, if it were not in fact itself an invention of German history, A Shylock, but a servile Shylock, it swears upon its bond, its historical, Christian-Germanic bond, for every pound of flesh cut from the heart of the people.  \xa0\xa0\xa0On the other hand, good-natured enthusiasts, German chauvinists by temperament and enlightened liberals by reflection, seek our history of liberty beyond our history, in the primeval Teutonic forests. But how does the history of our liberty differ from the history of the wild boar\'s liberty, if it is only to be found in the forests? And as the proverb has it: what is shouted into the forest, the forest echoes back. So peace upon the primeval Teutonic forests!  \xa0\xa0\xa0But war upon the state of affairs in Germany! By all means ! This state of affairs is beneath the level of history, beneath all criticism; nevertheless it remains an object of criticism just as the criminal who is beneath h umanity remains an object of the executioner. In its struggle against this state of affairs criticism is not a passion of the head, but the head of passion. It is not a lancet but a weapon. Its object is an enemy which it aims not to refute but to destroy. For the spirit of this state of affairs has already been refuted. It is not, in itself, an object worthy of our thought; it is an existence as contemptible as it is despised. Criticism itself has no need of any further elucidation of this object, for it has already understood it. Criticism is no longer an end in itself, but simply a means; indignation is its essential mode of feeling, and denunciation its principal task.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is a matter of depicting the stifling pressure which the different social spheres exert upon other, the universal but passive ill-humour, the complacent but self-deluding narrowness of spirit; all this incorporated in a system of government which lives by conserving this paltriness, and is itself paltriness in government.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0What a spectacle! Society is infinitely divided into the most diverse races, which confront each other with their petty antipathies, bad conscience and coarse mediocrity; and which, precisely because of their ambiguous and mistrustful situation, are treated without exception, though in different ways, as merely tolerated existences by their masters. And they are forced to recognize and acknowledge this fact of being dominated, governed and possessed, as a concession from heaven! On the other side are the rulers themselves, whose greatness is in inverse proportion to their number.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The criticism which deals with this subject-matter is criticism in a hand-to-hand fight; and in such a fight it is of no interest to know whether the adversary is of the same rank, is noble or interesting-all that matters is to strike him. It is a question of denying the Germans an instant of illusion or resignation. The burden must be made still more irksome by awakening a consciousness of it, and shame must be made more shameful still by rendering it public. Every sphere of German society must be depicted as the partie Honteuse of German society; and these petrified social conditions must be made to dance by singing their own melody to them. The nation must be taught to be terrified of itself, in order to give it courage. In this way an imperious need of the German nation will be satisfied, and the needs of nations are themselves the final causes of their satisfaction.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Even for the modern nations this struggle against the limited character of the German status quo does not lack interest; for the German status quo is the open consummation of the ancient régime, and the ancien régime is the hidden defect of the modern state.The struggle against the political present of the Germans is a struggle against the past of the modern nations, who are still continually importuned by the reminiscences of this past. It is instructive for the modern nations to see the ancien régime, which has played a tragic part in their history, play a comic part as a German ghost. The ancien régime had a tragic history, so long as it was the established power in the world while liberty was a personal fancy; in short, so long as it believed and had to believe in its own validity. So long as the ancien régime, as an existing world order, struggled against a new world which was just coming into existence, there was on its side a historical error but no personal error. Its decline was, therefore, tragic.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The present German regime, on the other hand, which is an anachronism, a flagrant contradiction of universally accepted axioms-the nullity of the ancien régime revealed to the whole world-only imagines that it believes in itself and asks the world to share its illusion. If it believed in its own nature would it attempt to hide it beneath the semblance of an alien nature and look for its salvation in hypocrisy and sophistry? The modern ancien régime is the comedian of a world order whose real heroes are dead. History is thorough, and it goes through many stages when it conducts an ancient formation to its grave. The last stage of a world-historical formation is comedy. The Greek gods, already once mortally wounded in Aeschylus\' tragedy Prometheus Bound, had to endure a second death, a comic death, in Lucian\'s dialogues. Why should history proceed in this way? So that mankind shall separate itself gladly from its past. We claim this joyful historical destiny for the political powers of Germany.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But as soon as criticism concerns itself with modern social and political reality, and thus arrives at genuine human problems, it must either go outside the German status quo or approach its object indirectly. For example, the relation of industry, of the world of wealth in general, to the political world is a major prob\xadlem of modern times. In what form does this problem begin to preoccupy the Germans? In the form of protective tariffs, the system of prohibition, the national economy. German chauvinism has passed from men to matter, so that one fine day our knights of cotton and heroes of iron found themselves metamorphosed into patriots. The sovereignty of monopoly within the country has begun to be recognized since sovereignty vis-á-vis foreign countries was attributed to it. In Germany, therefore, a beginning is made with what came as the conclusion •in France and England. The old, rotten order against which these nations revolt in their theories, and which they bear only as chains are borne, is hailed in Germany as the dawn of a glorious future which as yet hardly dares to move from a cunning3 theory to a ruthless practice. While in France and England the problem is put in the form : political economy or the rule of society over wealth; in Germany it is put in the form : national economy or the rule of private property over nationality. Thus, in England and France it is a question of abolishing monop-oly, which has developed to its final consequences; while in Ger\xadmany it is a question of proceeding to the final consequences of monopoly. There it is a question of the solution; here, only a ques\xadtion of the collision. We can see very well from this example how modem problems are presented in Germany; the example shows that our history, like a raw recruit, has so far only had to do extra drill on old and hackneyed historical matters.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If the whole of German development were at the level of German political development, a German could have no greater part in contemporary problems than can a Russian. If the individual is not restricted by the limitations of his country, still less is the nation liberated by the liberation of one indivdual. The fact that a Scythian was one of the Greek philosophers>sup>4 did not enable the Scythians to advance a single step towards Greek culture.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Fortunately, we Germans are not Scythians .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Just as the nations of the ancient world lived their pre-history in the imagination, in mythology, so we Germans have lived our post-history in thought, in philosophy. We are the philosophical contemporaries of the present day without being its historical contemporaries. German philosophy is the ideal prolongation of German history.When, therefore, we criticize, instead of the oeuvres incompletes of our real history, the oeuvres posthumes of our ideal history-philosophy, our criticism stands at the centre of the problems of which the present age says : that is the question. That which constitutes, for the advanced nations, a practical break With modern political conditions, is in Germany where these condi\xadtions do not yet exist, virtually a critical break with their philosophical reflection.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The German philosophy of right and of the state is the only German history which is al pari with the official modern times. The German nation is obliged, therefore, to connect its dream history with its present conditions, and to subject to criticism not only these existing conditions but also their abstract continuation. Its future cannot be restricted either to the direct negation of its real juridical and political circumstances, or to the direct realization of its ideal juridical and political circumstances. The direct negation of its real circumstances already exists in its ideal circumstances, while it has almost outlived the realization of its ideal circumstances in the contemplation of neighbouring nations. It is with good reason, therefore, that the practical political party in Germany demands the negation of philosophy. Its error does not consist in formulating this demand, but in limiting itself to a demand which it does not, and cannot, make effective. It supposes that it can achieve this negation by turning its back on philosophy, lookingelsewhere, and murmuring a few trite and ill-humoured phrases. Because of its narrow outlook it does not take account of philosophy as part of German reality, and even regards philosophy as beneath the level of German practical life and its theories. You demand as a point of departure real germs of life, but you forget that the real germ of life of the German nation has so far sprouted only in its cranium. In short, you cannot abolish philosophy without realizing it.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The same error was committed, but in the opposite direction, by the theoretical party which originated in philosophy.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In the present struggle, this party saw only the critical struggle of philosophy against the German world. It did not consider that previous philosophy itself belongs to this world and is its complement, even if only an ideal complement. Critical as regards its counterpart, it was not self-critical. It took as its point of departure the presuppositions of philosophy; and either accepted the conclusions which philosophy had reached or else presented as direct philosophical demands and conclusions, demands and conclusions drawn from elsewhere. But these latter-assuming their legitimacy-can only be achieved by the negation of previous philosophy, that is, philosophy as philosophy. We shall provide later a more compre\xadhensive account of this party. Its principal defect may be summarized as follows : it believed that it could realize philosophy without abolishing it.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The criticism of the German philosophy of right and of the state  which was given its most logical, profound and complete expression by Hegel, is at once the critical analysis of the modern state and of the reality connected with it, and the definitive negation of all the past forms of consciousness in German jurisprudence and politics, whose most distinguished and most general expression, raised to the level of a science, is precisely the speculative philosophy of right. If it was only Germany which could produce the speculative philosophy of right-this extravagant and abstract thought about the modern state, the reality of which remains in the beyond ( even if this beyond is only across the Rhine ) -the German representative of the modern state, on the contrary, which leaves out of account the real man was itself only possible because, and to the extent that, the modern state itself  leaves the real man out of account or only satisfies the whole man in an illusory way. In politics, the Ger\xadmans have thought what other nations have done. Germany has been their theoretical consciousness. The abstraction and presumption of its philosophy was in step with the partial and stunted char\xadacter of their reality. If, therefore, the status quo of the German political system expresses the consummation of the ancien régime, the thorn in the flesh of the modern state, the status quo of German political science expresses the imperfection of the modern state itself, the degeneracy of its flesh.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0As the determined adversary of the previous form of German political consciousness, the criticism of the speculative philosophy of right does not remain within its own sphere, but leads on to tasks which can only be solved by means of practical activity.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The question then arises: can Germany attain a practical activity a la hauteur des principles; that is to say, a revolution which will raise it not only to the official level of the modern nations, but to the human level which will be the immediate future of those nations.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It is clear that the arm of criticism cannot replace the criticism of arms. Material force can only be overthrown by material force; but theory itself becomes a material force when it has seized the masses. Theory is capable of seizing the masses when it demon-strates ad hominem, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp things by the root. But for man the root is man himself. What proves beyond doubt the radicalism of German theory, and thus its practical energy, is that it begins from the resolute positive abolition of religion. The criti\xadcism of religion ends with the doctrine that man is the supreme being for man. It ends, therefore, with the categorical imperative to overthrow all those conditions in which man is an abased, enslaved, abandoned, contemptible being-conditions which can hardly be better described than in the exclamation of a Frenchman on the occasion of a proposed tax upon dogs : ""\'Wretched dogs! They want to treat you like men!""  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Even from the historical standpoint theoretical emancipation has a specific practical importance for Germany. In fact Germany\'s revolutionary past is theoretical-it is the Reformation. In that period the revolution originated in the brain of a monk, today in the brain of the philosopher.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Luther, without question, overcame servitude through devotion but only by substituting servitude through conviction. He shattered the faith in authority by restoring the authority of faith. He transformed the priests into laymen by turning laymen into priests . He liberated man from external religiosity by making religiosity the innermost essence of man. He liberated the body from its chains because he fettered the heart with chains.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But if Protestantism was not the solution it did at least pose the problem correctly. It was no longer a question, thereafter, of the layman\'s struggle against the priest outside himself, but of his struggle against his own internal priest, against his own priestly nature. And if the Protestant metamorphosis of German laymen into priests emancipated the lay popes-the princes together withtheir clergy, the privileged and the philistines-the philosophical metamorphosis of the priestly Germans into men will emancipate the people. But just as emancipation will not be confined to princes, so the secularization of property will not be limited to the confiscation of church property, which was practised especially by hypocritical Prussia. At that time, the Peasant War, the most radical event in German history, came to grief because of theology.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Today, when theology itself has come to grief, the most unfree phenomenon in German history-our status quo-will be shattered by philosophy. On the eve of the Reformation official Germany was the most abject servant of Rome. On the eve of its revolution Germany is the abject servant of those who are far inferior to Rome; of Prussia and Austria, of petty squires and philistines.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But a radical revolution in Germany seems to encounter a major difficulty.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Revolutions need a passive element, a material basis. Theory is only realized in a people so far as it fulfils the needs of the people. Will there correspond to the monstrous discrepancy between the demands of German thought and the answers of German reality a similar discrepancy between civil society and the state, and within civil society itself? Will theoretical needs be directly practical needs? It is not enough that thought should seek to realize itself; reality must also strive towards thought.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But Germany has not passed through the intermediate stage of political emancipation at the same time as the modern nations. It has not yet attflined in practice those stages which it has transcended in theory. How could Germany, in salta mortale, surmount not only its own barriers but also those of the modern nations, that is, those barriers which it must in reality experience and strive for as an emancipation from its own real barriers? A radical revolution can only be a revolution of radical needs, for which the conditions and breeding ground appear to be lacking.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But if Germany accompanied the development of the modern nations only through the abstract activity of thought, without taking an active part in the real struggles of this development, it has also experienced the pains of this development without sharing in its pleasures and partial satisfactions. The abstract activity on one side has its counterpart in the abstract suffering on the other. And one fine day Germany will find itself at the level of the European decadence, before ever having attained the level of European emancipation. It will be comparable to a fetishist who is sickening from the diseases of Christianity.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If the German governments are examined it will be found that the circumstances of the time, the situation of Germany, the outlook of German culture, and lastly their own fortunate instinct, all drive them to combine the civilized deficiencies of the modern political world (whose advantages we do not enjoy) with the barbarous deficiencies of the ancien régime (which we enjoy in full measure); so that Germany must participate more and more, if not in the reason at least in the unreason of those political systems which transcend its status quo. Is there, for example, any country in the whole world which shares with such naivete as so-called constitutional Germany all the illusions of the constitutional régime without sharing its realities? And was it not, of necessity, a German government which had the idea of combining the torments of cen\xadsorship with the torments of the French September laws5 which presuppose the liberty of the Press? Just as the gods of all the nations were to be found in the Roman Pantheon, so there will be found in the Holy Roman German Empire an the sins of all the forms of State. That this eclecticism will attain an unprecedented degree is assured in particular by the politico-aesthetic gourmandise of a German king who proposes to play all the roles of royalty feudal or bureaucratic, absolute or constitutional, autocratic or democratic-if not in the person of the people at least in his own person, and if not for the people, at least for himself Germany, as the deficiency of present-day politics constituted into a system, will not be able to demolish the specific German barriers without demolishing the general barriers of present-day politics.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It is not radical revolution,universal human emancipation, which is a Utopian dream for Germany, but rather a partial, merely political revolution which leaves the pillars of the building standing. What is the basis of a partial, merely political revolution? Simply this: a section of civil society emancipates itself and attains universal domination; a determinate class undertakes, from its particular situation, a general emancipation of society. This class emancipates society as a whole, but only on condition that the whole of society is in the same situation as this class; for example, that it possesses or can easily acquire money or culture.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0No class in civil society can play this part unless it can arouse, in itself and in the masses, a moment of enthusiasm in which it associates and mingles with society at large, identifies itself with it, and is felt and recognized as the general representative of this society. Its aims and interests must genuinely be the aims and interests of society itself, of which it becomes in reality the social head and heart. It is only in the name of general interests that a particular class can claim general supremacy. In order to attain this liberating position, and the political direction of all spheres of society, revolutionary energy and consciousness of its own power do not suffice. For a popular revolution and the emancipation of a particular class of civil society to coincide, for one class to represent the whole of society, another class must concentrate in itself all the evils of society, a particular class must embody and represent a general obstacle and limitation. A particular social sphere must be regarded as the notorious crime of the whole society, so that emancipation from this sphere appears as a general emancipation. For one class to be the liberating class par excellence, it is necessary that another class should be openly the oppressing class. The negative significance of the French nobility and clergy produced the positive significance of the bourgeoisie, the class which stood next to them and opposed them.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 But in Germany every class lacks the logic, insight, courage and clarity which would make it a negative representative of society. Moreover, there is also lacking in every class the generosity of spirit which identifies itself, if only for a moment, with the popular mind; that genius which pushes material force to political power, that revolutionary daring which throws at its adversary the defiant phrase: I am nothing and I should be everything. The essence of German morality and honour, in classes as in individuals, is a modest egoism which displays, and allows others to display, its own narrowness. The relation between the different spheres of German society is, therefore, not dramatic, but epic. Each of these spheres begins to be aware of itself and to establish itself beside the others, not from the moment when it is oppressed, but from the moment that circumstances, without any action of its own, have created a new sphere which it can in turn oppress. Even the moral sentiment of the German middle class  has no other basis than the consciousness of being the representative of the narrow and limited mediocrity of all the other classes. It is not only the German kings, therefore, who ascend their thrones mal a propos. Each sphere of civil society suffers a defeat before gaining the victory; it erects its own barrier before having destroyed the barrier which opposes it; it displays the narrowness of its views before having displayed their generosity, and thus every opportunity of playing an important role has passed before it properly existed, and each class, at the very moment when it begins its struggle against the class above it, remains involved in a struggle against the class beneath. For this reason, the princes are in conflict with the monarch, the bureaucracy with the nobility, the bourgeoisie with all of them, while the proletariat is already beginning its struggle with the bourgeoisie. The middle class hardly dares to conceive the idea of emancipation from its own point of view before• the development of social conditions, and the progress of political theory, show that this point of view is already antiquated, or at least disputable.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In France it is enough to be something in order to desire to be everything. In Germany no one has the right to be anything without first renouncing everything. In France partial emancipation is a basis for complete emancipation. In Germany complete emancipation is a conditio sine qua non for any partial emancipation. In France it is the reality, in Germany the impossibility, of a progressive emancipation which must give birth to complete liberty. In France every class of the population is politically idealistic and con\xadsiders itself first of all, not as a particular class, but as the representative of the general needs of society. The role of liberator can, therefore, pass successively in a dramatic movement to different classes in the population, until it finally reaches the class which achieves social freedom; no longer assuming certain conditions external to man, which are none the less created by human society, but organizing all the conditions of human life on the basis of social freedom. In Germany, on the contrary, where practical life is as little intellectual as intellectual life is practical, no class of civil society feels the need for, or the ability to achieve, a general eman\xadcipation, until it is forced to it by its immediate situation, by materia necessity and by its fetters themselves.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Where is there, then, a real possibility of emancipation in Germany?  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0This is our reply. A class must be formed which has radical chains, a class in civil society which is not a class of civil society, a class which is the dissolution of all classes, a sphere of society which has a universal character because its sufferings are universal, and which does not claim a particular redress because the wrong which is done to it is not a particular wrong but wrong in general. There must be formed a sphere of society which claims no tradi\xadtional status but only a human status, a sphere which is not opposed to particular consequences but is totally opposed to the assumptions of the German political system; a sphere, finally, which cannot emancipate itself without emancipating itself from all the other spheres of society, without, therefore, emancipating all these other spheres, which is, in short, a total loss of humanity and which can only redeem itself by a total redemption of humanity. This dissolution of society, as a particular class, is the proletariat.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The proletariat is only beginning to form itself in Germany, as a result of the industrial movement. For what constitutes the proletariat is not naturally existing poverty, but poverty artificially produced, is not the mass of people mechanically oppressed by the weight of society, but the mass resulting from the disintegration of society and above all from the disintegration of the middle class. Needless to say, however, the numbers of the proletariat are also increased by the victims of natural poverty and of Christian-Germanic serfdom.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0When the proletariat announces the dissolution of the existing social order, it only declares the secret of its own existence, for it is the effective dissolution of this order. When the proletariat demands the negation of private property it only lays down as a principle for society what society has already made a principle for the proletariat, and what the latter already involuntarily embodies as the negative result of society. Thus the proletarian has the same right, in relation to the new world which is coming into being, as the German king  has in relation to the existing world when he calls the people his people or a horse his horse. In calling the people his private property the king simply declares that the owner of private property is king.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Just as philosophy finds its material weapons in the proletariat, so the proletariat finds its intellectual weapons in philosophy. And once the lightning of thought has penetrated deeply into this virgin soil of the people, the Germans will emancipate themselves and become men.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Let us sum up these results. The emancipation of Germany is only possible in practice if one adopts the point of view of that theory according to which man is the highest being for man. Germany will not be able to emancipate itself from the Middle ages unless it emancipates itself at the same time from the partial victories over the Middle Ages. In Germany no type of enslavement can be abolished unless all enslavement is destroyed. Germany, which likes to get to the bottom of things, can only make a revolution which upsets the whole order of things. The emancipation of Germany will be an emancipation of man. Philosophy is the head of this emancipation and the proletariat is its heart. Philosophy can only be realized by the abolition 6 of the proletariat, and the proletariat can only be abolished by the realization of philosophy.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0When all the inner conditions ripen, the day of German resurrection will be proclaimed by the crowing of the Gallic cock.7  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Economic and Philosophic \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 Manuscripts of 1844 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0KARL MARX  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Soon after moving to Paris in November, 1843, Marx applied himself to the criticism of political economy-the new phase of his critical program foreshadowed in his two essays in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher. Between April and August of 1844 he produced the rough draft of what, judging by his preface, Was to have been a book. He did not finish it for publication, however, and it lay unpublished for more than eighty years. The surviving parts, comprising four manuscripts, were given the name shown above. An incomplete version in Russian translation was published in Moscow in 1927. The first full edition in German, prepared by D. Riazanov of the Marx•Engels Institute in Moscow, was published in Berlin in 1932, in Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Historisch-kritische Gesamtausgabe.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The fundamentals of the Marxist interpretation of history are to be found in the 1844 manuscripts, including the notion of the proletarian revolution and future communism as the goal of the historical process. The theory is set forth, however, in terms of philosophical concepts drawn by Marx from Hegel and Feuerbach, most notably the concept of man\'s ""self-alienation"" or ""self-estrangement."" History, particularly under modern capitalism, is seen as a story of man\'s alienation in his life as producer, and communism is presented as the final transcendence of alienation via a revolution against private property. Because the 1844 manuscripts show us Marxism at the moment of its genesis in Marx\'s mind and because they help to clarify both the relation of Marxism to earlier German philosophy and its ethical significance, their publication has profoundly affected schoolarship on Marx and Marxism in our time.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 A part of the manuscripts consists largely of excerpts from writings of the political economists on such topics as wages of labor, profit of capital, and rent of land. The material reprinted here, comprising the extant portions in which Marx expounds his own position, consists of the preface and the sections entitled ""Estranged Labour,"" ""Private Property and Communism,"" ""The Meaning of Human Requirements,"" ""The Power of Money in Bourgeois Society,"" and ""Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy as a Whole.""  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 A number of passages in the manuscripts have been crossed out, apparently by Marx. There is no reason to think that the passages crossed out had ceased to represent what Marx thought. He may well have been guided by editorial considerations in working over the draft of a manuscript originally intended for publication.*  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Preface  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 I have already given notice in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher of the critique of jurisprudence and political science in the form of a critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right. In the course of elaboration for publication, the intermingling of criticism directed only against speculation with criticism of the various subjects themselves proved utterly unsuitable, hampering the development of the argument and rendering comprehension difficult. Moreover the wealth and diversity of the subjects to be treated, could have been compressed into one work only in a purely aphoristic style; whilst an aphoristic presentation of this kind, for its part, would have given the impression of arbitrary systematizing. I shall therefore issue the critique of law, ethics, politics, etc., in a series of distinct, independent pamphlets, and at the end try in a special work to present them again as a connected whole showing the interrelationship of the separate parts, and finally, shall make a critique of the speculative elaboration of that material. For this reason it will be found that the interconnection between political economy and the state, law, ethics, civil life, etc., is touched on in the present work only to the extent to which political economy itself ex professo1 touches on these subjects.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 It is hardly necessary to assure the reader conversant with political economy that my results have been won by means of a wholly empirical analysis based on a conscientious critical study of political economy.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0   \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It is only with Feuerbach that positive, humanistic and naturalistic criticism begins. The less noise they make, the more certain, profound, widespread and enduring is the effect of Feuerbach\'s writings, the only writings since Hegel\'s Phanomenologie and Logik to contain a real theoretical revolution.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In contrast to the critical theologians9 of our day, I have deemed the concluding chapter of the present work-the settling of accounts with Hegelian dialectic and Hegelian philosophy as a whole-to be absolutely necessary, a task not yet performed. This lack of thoroughness is not accidental, since even the critical theologian remains a theologian. Hence, either he had to start from certain presuppositions of. philosophy accepted as authoritative; or if in the process of criticism and as a result of other people\'s discoveries doubts about these philosophical presuppositions have arisen in him, he abandons them without vindication and in a cowardly fashion, abstracts from them showing his servile dependence on these presuppositions and his resentment at this dependence merely in a negative, unconscious and sophistical manner.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  2  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0On close inspection theological criticism-genuinely progressive though it was at the inception of the movement-is seen in the final analysis to be nothing but the culmination and consequence of the old philosophical, and especially the Hegelian, transcendentalism, twisted into a theological caricature. This interesting example of the justice in history, which now assigns to theology, ever philosophy\'s spot of infection, the further role of portraying in itself the negative dissolution of philosophy-i.e., the process of its decay-this historical nemesis I shall demonstrate on another occasion.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0   \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0   Estranged Labour3  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 We have proceeded from the premises of political economy. We have accepted its language and its laws. We presupposed private property, the separation of labour, capital and land, and of wages, profit of capital and rent of land-likewise division of labour, competition, the concept of exchange-value, etc. On the basis of political economy itself, in its own words, we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the  most wretched of commodities; that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production; that the necessary result of competition is the accumu¬lation of capital in a few hands, and thus the restoration of monopoly in a more terrible form; that finally the distinction between capitalist and land-rentier, like that between the tiller of the soil and the factory-worker, disappears and that the whole of society must I fall apart into the two classes-the property-owners and the propertyless workers.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Political economy proceeds from the fact of private property, but it does not explain it to us. It expresses in general, abstract formulae the material process through which private property actually passes, and these formulae it then takes for laws. It does not comprehend these laws-i.e., it does not demonstrate how they arise from the very nature of private property. Political economy does not disclose the source of the division between labour and capital, and between capital and land. When, for example, it defines the relationship of wages to profit, it takes the interest of the capitalists to be the ultimate cause; i.e., it takes for granted what it is supposed to evolve. Similarly, competition comes in everywhere. It is explained from external circumstances. As to how far these external and apparently fortuitous circumstances are but the expression of a necessary course of development, political economy teaches us nothing. We have seen how, to it, exchange itself appears to be afortuitous fact. The only wheels which political economy sets in  motion are avarice and the war amongst the avaricious competition.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Precisely because political economy does not grasp the connections within the movement, it was possible to counterpose, for instance, the doctrine of competition to the doctrine of monopoly, the doctrine of craft-liberty to the doctrine of the corporation, the doctrine of the division of landed property to the doctrine of the big estate-for competition, craft-liberty and the division of landed property were explained and comprehended only as fortuitous, premeditated and violent consequences of monopoly, the corporation; and feudal property, not as their necessary, inevitable and natural consequences.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Now, therefore, we have to grasp the essential connection between private property, avarice, and the separation of labour, capital and landed property; between exchange and competition, value and the devaluation of men, monopoly and competition, etc.; the connection between this whole estrangement and the money system.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Do not let us go back to a fictitious primordial condition as the political economist does, when he tries to explain. Such a primor dial condition explains nothing. He merely pushes the question away into a grey nebulous distance. He assumes in the form of fact, of an event, what he is supposed to deduce-namely, the necessary relationship between two things-between, for example, division of labour and exchange. Theology in the same way explains the origin of evil by the fall of man: that is, it assumes as a fact, in historical form, what has to be explained.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We proceed from an actual economic fact.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and range. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. With the increasing value of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion the devaluation of the world of men. Labour produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity-and does so in the proportion in which it produces commodities generally.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0This fact expresses merely that the object which labour produces-labour\'s product-confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labour is labour which has been congealed in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labour. Labour\'s realization is its objectification. In the conditions dealt with by political economy this realization of labour appears as loss of reality for the workers; objectification as loss of the object and object-bondage; appropriation as estrangement, as alienation.4  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0So much does labour\'s realization appear as loss of reality that the worker loses reality to the point of starving to death. So much does objectification appear as loss of the object that the worker is robbed of the objects most necessary not only for his life but for his work. Indeed, labour itself becomes an object which he can get hold of only with the greatest effort and with the most irregular interruptions. So much does the appropriation of the object appear as estrangement that the more objects the worker produces the fewer can he possess and the more he falls under the dominion of his product, capital.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0All these consequences are contained in the definition that the worker is related to the product of his labour as to an alien object. For on this premise it is clear that the more the worker spends himself, the more powerful the alien objective world becomes which he creates over-against himself, the poorer he himself-his inner world-becomes, the less belongs to him as his own. It is the same in religion. The more man puts into God, the less he retains in himself. The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object. Hence, the greater this activity, the greater is the worker\'s lack of objects. Whatever the product of his labour is, he is not. Therefore the greater this product, the less is he himself. The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labour becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power of its own confronting him; it means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Let us now look more closely at the objectification, at the production of the worker; and therein at the estrangement, the loss of the object, his product.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The worker can create nothing without nature, without the sensuous external world. It is the material on which his labor is manifested, in which it is active, from which and by means of which it produces.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But just as nature provides labor with the means of life in the sense that labour cannot live without objects on which to operate, on the other hand, it also provides the means of life in the more restricted sense-i.e., the means for the physical subsistence of the worker himself.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thus the more the worker by his labour appropriates the external world, sensuous nature, the more he deprives himself of means of life in the double respect: first, that the sensuous external world more and more ceases to be an object belonging to his labour-to be his labour\'s means of life; and secondly, that it more and more ceases to be means of life in the immediate sense, means for the physical subsistence of the worker.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thus in this double respect the worker becomes a slave of his object, first, in that he receives an object of labour, i.e., in that he receives work; and secondly, in that he receives means of subsistence. Therefore, it enables him to exist, first, as a worker; and, second, as a physical subject. The extremity of this bondage is that it is only as a worker that he continues to maintain himself as a physical subject, and that it is only as a physical subject that he is a worker.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (The laws of political economy express the estrangement of the worker in his object thus: the more the worker produces, the less he has to consume; the more values he creates, the more valueless, the more unworthy he becomes; the better formed his product, the more deformed becomes the worker; the more civilized his object, the more barbarous becomes the worker; the mightier labour becomes, the more powerless becomes the worker; the more ingenious labour becomes, the duller becomes the worker and the more he becomes nature\'s bondsman.)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Political economy conceals the estrangement inherent in the nature of labour by not considering the direct relationship between the worker (labour) and production. It is true that labour produces for the rich wonderful things-but for the worker it produces privation. It produces palaces-but for the worker, hovels. It produces beauty-but for the worker, deformity. It replaces labour by machines-but some of the workers it throws back to a barbarous type of labour, and the other workers it turns into machines. It produces intelligence-but for the worker idiocy, cretinism.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The direct relationship of labour to its produce is the relationship of the worker to the objects of his production. The relationship of the man of means to the objects of production and to production itself is only a consequence of this first relationship-mid confirms it. We shall consider this other aspect later.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0When we ask, then, what is the essential relationship of labour we are asking about the relationship of the worker to production.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Till now we have been considering the estrangement, the alienation of the worker only in one of its aspects, i.e., the worker\'s relationship to the products of his labour. But the estrangement is manifested not only in the result but in the act of production¬within the producing activity itself. How would the worker come to face the product of his activity as a stranger, were it not that in the very act of production he was estranging himself from himself? The product is after all but the summary of the activity of production.  If then the product of labour is alienation, production itself must be active alienation, the alienation of activity, the activity of alienation. In the estrangement of the object of labour is merely summarized the estrangement, the alienation, in the activity of labour itself.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 What, then, constitutes the alienation of labour?  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 First, the fact that labour is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his essential being; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working, and when he is working he is not at home. His labour is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labour. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labour is shunned like the plague. External labour, labour in which man alienates himself, is a labour of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labour for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else\'s, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates independently of the individual-that is, operates on him as an alien, divine or diabolical activity-in the same way the worker\'s activity is not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 As a result. therefore, man (the worker) no longer feels himself to be freely active in any but his animal functions-eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc.; and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 Certainly eating, drinking, procreating, etc., are also genuinely human functions. But in the abstraction which separates them from the sphere of all other human activity and turns them into sole and ultimate ends, they are animal.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 We have considered the act of estranging practical human activity, labour, in two of its aspects. (1) The relation of the worker to the product of labour as an alien object exercising power over him. This relation is at the same time the relation to the sensuous external world, to the objects of nature as an alien world antagonistically opposed to him. (2) The relation of labour to the act of production within the labour process. This relation is the relation of theworker to his own activity as an alien activity not belonging to him; it is activity as suffering, strength as weakness, begetting as emasculating, the worker\'s own physical and mental energy, his personal life or what is life other than activity-as an activity which is turned against him, neither depends on nor belongs to him. Here we have self-estrangement, as we had previously the estrangement of the thing.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We have yet a third aspect of estranged labour to deduce from the two already considered.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Man is a species being, not only because in practice and in theory he adopts the species as his object (his own as well as those of other things), but-and this is only another way of expressing it-but also because he treats himself as the actual, living species; because he treats himself as a universal and therefore a free being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The life of the species, both in man and in animals, consists physically in the fact that man (like the animal) lives on inorganic nature; and the more universal man is compared with an animal, the more universal is the sphere of inorganic nature on which he lives. Just as plants, animals, stones, the air, light, etc., constitute a part of human consciousness in the realm of theory, partly as objects of natural science, partly as objects of art-his spiritual inorganic nature, spiritual nourishment which he must first prepare to make it palatable and digestible-so too in the realm of practice they constitute a part of human life and human activity. Physically man lives only on these products of nature, whether they appear in the form of food, heating, clothes, a dwelling, or whatever it may be. The universality of man is in practice manifested precisely in the universality which makes all nature his inorganic body-both inasmuch as nature is (1) his direct means of life, and (2) the material, the object, and the instrument of his life-activity. Nature is man\'s inorganic body-nature, that is, in so far as it is not itself the human body. Man lives on nature-means that nature is his body, with which he must remain in continuous intercourse if he is not to die. That man\'s physical and spiritual life is linked to nature means simply that nature is linked to itself, for man is a part of nature.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In estranging from man (1) nature, and (2) himself, his own active functions, his life-activity, estranged labour estranges the species from man. It turns for him the life of the species into a means of individual life. First it estranges the life of the species and individual life, and secondly it makes individual life in its abstract form the purpose of the life of the species, likewise in its abstract and estranged form.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0For in the first place labour, life-activity, productive life itself, appears to man merely as a means of satisfying a need-the need to maintain the physical existence. Yet the productive life is the life of the species. It is life-engendering life. The whole character of a species-its species character-is contained in the character of its life-activity; and free, conscious activity is man\'s species character. Life itself appears only as a means to life.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The animal is immediately identical with its life-activity. It does not distinguish itself from it. It is its life-activity. Man makes his life-activity itself the object of his will and of his consciousness. He has conscious life-activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life-activity directly distinguishes man from animal life-activity. It is just because of this that he is a species being. Or it is only because he is a species being that he is a Conscious Being, i.e., that his own life is an object for him. Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour reverses this relationship, so that it is just because man is a conscious being that he makes his life-activity, his essential being, a mere means to his existence.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In creating an objective world by his practical activity, in working-up inorganic nature, man proves himself a conscious species being, i.e., as a being that treats the species as its own essential being, or that treats itself as a species being. Admittedly animals also produce. They build themselves nests, dwellings, like the bees, beavers, ants, etc. But an animal only produces what it immediately needs for itself or its young. It produces one-sidedly, whilst man produces universally. It produces. only under the dominion of immediate physical need, whilst man produces even when he is free from physical need and only truly produces in freedom therefrom. An animal produces only itself, whilst man reproduces the whole of nature. An animal\'s product belongs immediately to its physical body, whilst man freely confronts his product. An animal forms things in accordance with the standard and the need of the species to which it belongs, whilst man knows how to produce in accordance with the standard of every species, and knows how to apply everywhere the inherent standard to the object. Man therefore also forms things in accordance with the laws of beauty.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It is just in the working-up of the objective world, therefore, that man first really proves himself to be a species being. This production is his active species life. Through and because of this production, nature appears as his work and his reality. The object of la bour is, therefore, the objectification of man\'s species life: for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he contemplates himself in a world that he has created. In tearing away from man the object of his production, therefore, estranged labour tears from him his species life, his real species objectivity, and transforms his advantage over animals into the disadvantage that his inorganic body, nature, is taken from him.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Similarly, in degrading spontaneous activity, free activity, to a means, estranged labour makes man\'s species life a means to his physical existence.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The consciousness which man has of his species is thus transformed by estrangement in such a way that the species life becomes for him a means.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Estranged labour turns thus:  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (3) Man\'s species being, both nature and his spiritual species property, into a being alien to him, into a means to his individual existence. It estranges man\'s own body from him, as it does external nature and his spiritual essence, his human being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (4) An immediate consequence of the fact that man is estranged from the product of his labour, from his life-activity, from his species being is the estrangement of man from man. If a man is confronted by himself, he is confronted by the other man. ""What applies to a man\'s relation to his work, to the product of his labour and to himself, also holds of a man\'s relation to the other man, and to the other man\'s labour and object of labour.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In fact, the proposition that man\'s species nature is estranged from him means that one man is estranged from the other, as each of them is from man\'s essential nature.5  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The estrangement of man, and in fact every relationship in which man stands to himself, is first realized and expressed in the relationship in which a man stands to other men.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Hence within the relationship of estranged labour each man views the other in accordance with the standard and the position in which he finds himself as a worker.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We took our departure from a fact of political economy-the estrangement of the worker and his production. We have formulated the concept of this fact-estranged, alienated labour. We have analysed this concept-hence analysing merely a fact of political economy.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Let us now see, further, how in real life the concept of estranged, alienated labour must express and present itself. If the product of labour is alien to me, if it confronts me as an alien power, to whom, then, does it belong?  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If my own activity does not belong to me, if it is an alien, a coerced activity, to whom, then, does it belong?  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0To a being other than me.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Who is this being?  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The gods? To be sure, in the earliest times the principal production (for example, the building of temples, etc., in Egypt, India and Mexico) appears to be in the service of the gods, and the product belongs to the gods. However, the gods on their own were never the lords of labour. No more was nature. And what a contradiction it would be if, the more man subjugated nature by his labour and the more the miracles of the gods were rendered superfluous by the miracles of industry, the more man were to renounce the joy of production and the enjoyment of the produce in favour of these powers.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The alien being, to whom labour and the produce of labour belongs, in whose service labour is done and for whose benefit the produce of labour is provided, can only be man himself.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If the product of labour does not belong to the worker, if it confronts him as an alien power, this can only be because it belongs to some other man than the worker. If the worker\'s activity is a torment to him, to another it must be delight and his life\'s joy. Not the gods, not nature, but only man himself can be this alien power over man.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We must bear in mind the above-stated proposition that man\'s relation to himself only becomes objective and real for him through his relation to the other man. Thus, if the product of his labour, his labour objectified, is for him an alien, hostile, powerful object independent of him, then his position towards it is such that someone else is master of this object, someone who is alien, hostile, powerful, and independent of him. If his own activity is to him an unfree activity, then he is treating it as activity performed in the service, under the dominion, the coercion and the yoke of another man.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Every self-estrangement of man from himself and from nature appears in the relation in which he places himself and nature to men other than and differentiated from himself. For this reason religious self-estrangement necessarily appears in the relationship of the layman to the priest, or again to a mediator, etc., since we are here dealing with the intellectual world. In the real practical world self-estrangement can only become manifest through \'the real practical relationship to other men. The medium through which estrangement takes place is itself practical. Thus through estranged labour man not only engenders his relationship to the object and to the act of production as to powers that are alien and hostile to him; he also engenders the relationship in which other men stand to his production and to his product, and the relationship in which he stands to these other men. Just as he begets his own production as the, loss of his reality, as his punishment; just as he begets his own product as a loss, as a product not belonging to him; so he begets the dominion of the one who does not produce over production and over the product. Just as he estranges from himself his own activity, so he confers to the stranger activity which is not his own.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Till now we have only considered this relationship from the standpoint of the worker and later we shall be considering it also from the standpoint of the non-worker.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Through estranged, alienated labour, then, the worker produces the relationship to this labour of a man alien to labour and standing outside it. The relationship of the worker to labour engenders the relation to it of the capitalist, or whatever one chooses to call the master of labour. Private property is thus the product, the result, the necessary consequence, of alienated labour, of the external relation of the worker to nature and to himself.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Private property thus results by analysis from the concept of alienated labour-i.e., of alienated man, of estranged labour, of estranged life, of. estranged man.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0True, it is as a result of the movement of private property  that we have obtained the concept of alienated labour (of alienated life) from political economy. But on analysis of this concept it becomes clear that though private property appears to be the source, the cause of alienated labour, it is really its consequence, just as the gods in the beginning are not the cause but the effect of man\'s intellectual confusion. Later this relationship becomes reciprocal.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Only at the very culmination of the development of private property does this, its secret, re-emerge, namely, that on the one hand it is the product of alienated labour, and that secondly it is the means by which labour alienates itself, the realization of this alienation.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0This exposition immediately sheds light on various hitherto unsolved conflicts.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (1) Political economy starts from labour as the real soul of production; yet to labour it gives nothing, and to private property everything. From this contradiction Proudhon has concluded in favour of labour and against private property. We understand, however, that this apparent contradiction is the contradiction of estranged labour with itself, and that political economy has merely formulated the laws of estranged labour.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We also understand, therefore, that wages and private property are identical: where the product, the object of labour pays for labour itself, the wage is but a necessary consequence of labour\'s estrangement, for after all in the wage of labour, labour does not appear as an end in itself but as the servant of the wage. We shall develop this point later, and meanwhile will only deduce some conclusions.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0A forcing-up of wages (disregarding all other difficulties, including the fact that it would only be by force, too, that the higher wages, being an anomaly, could be maintained) would therefore be nothing but better payment for the slave, and would not conquer either for the worker or for labour their human status and dignity.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Indeed, even the equality of wages demanded by Proudhon only transforms the relationship of the present-day worker to his labour into the relationship of all men to labour. Society is then conceived as an abstract capitalist.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Wages are a direct consequence of estranged labour, and estranged labour is the direct cause of private property. The downfall of the one aspect must therefore mean the downfall of the other.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (2) From the relationship of estranged labour to private property it further follows that the emancipation of society from private property, etc., from servitude, is expressed in the political form of the emancipation of the workers; not that their emancipation alone was at stake but because the emancipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation-and it contains this, because the whole of human servitude is involved in the relation of the worker to production, and every relation of servitude is but a modification and consequence of this relation.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Just as we have found the concept of private property from the concept of estranged, alienated labour by analysis, in the same way every category of political economy can be evolved with the help of these two factors; and we shall find again in each category, e.g., trade, competition, capital, money, only a definite and developed expression of the first foundations.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Before considering this configuration, however, let us try to solve two problems.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (1) To define the general nature of private property, as it has arisen as a result of estranged labour, in its relation to truly human, social property.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (2) We have accepted the estrangement of labour, its alienation, as a fact, and we have analysed this fact. How, we now ask, does man come to alienate, to estrange, his labour? How is this estrangement rooted in the nature of human development? We have already gone a long way to the solution of this problem by transforming the question as to the origin of private property into the question as to the relation of alienated labour to the course of humanity\'s development. For when one speaks of private property, one thinks of being concerned with something external to man. When one speaks of labour, one is directly concerned with man himself. This new formulation of the question already contains its solution.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 As to (1): The general nature of private property and its relation to truly human property.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Alienated labour has resolved itself for us into two elements which mutually condition one another, or which are but different expressions of one and the same relationship. Appropriation appears as estrangement, as alienation; and alienation appears as appropriation, estrangement as true enfranchisement.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 We have considered the one side-alienated labour in relation to the worker himself, i.e., the relation of alienated labour to itself. The property-relation of the non-worker to the worker and to labour we have found as the product, the necessary outcome of this relation of alienated labour. Private property, as the material, summary expression of alienated labour, embraces both relations-the relation of the worker to work, to the product of his labour and to the non-worker, and the relation of the non-worker to the worker and to the product of his labor.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Having seen that in relation to the worker who appropriates nature by means of his labour, this appropriation appears as estrangement, his own spontaneous activity as activity for another and as activity of another, vitality as a sacrifice of life, production of the object as loss of the object to an alien power, to an alien person-we shall now consider the relation to the worker, to labour and its object of this person who is alien to labour and the worker.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 First it has to be noticed, that everything which appears in the worker as an activity of alienation, of estrangement, appears in the non-wor ker as a state of alienation, of estrangement. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Secondly, that the worker\'s real, practical attitude in production and to the product (as a state of mind ) appears in the non-worker confronting him as a theoretical attitude.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Thirdly, the non-worker does everything against the worker which the worker does against himself; but he does not do against himself what he does against the worker.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Let us look more closely at these three relations.6  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 Private Property and Communism  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Re. p. XXXIX. The antithesis of propertylessness and property so long as it is not comprehended as the antithesis of labour and capital, still remains an antithesis of indifference, not grasped in its active connection, its internal relation-an antithesis not yet grasped as a contradiction. It can find expression in this first form even without the advanced development of private property ( as in ancient Rome, Turkey, etc.). It does not yet appear as having been established by private property itself. But labour, the subjective essence of private property as exclusion of property, and capital, objective labour as exclusion of labour, constitute private property as its developed state of contradiction-hence a dynamic relationship moving inexorably to its resolution.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Re. the same page. The transcendence of self-estrangement follows the same course as self-estrangement. Private property is first considered only in its objective aspect-but nevertheless with labour as its essence. Its form of existence is therefore capital, which is to be annulled ""as such"" (Proudhon). Or a particular form of labour-labour levelled down, parcelled, and therefore unfree-is conceived as the source of private property\'s perniciousness and of its existence in estrangement from men; for instance, Fourier, who, like the physiocrats, also conceived agricultural labour to be at least the exemplary type, whilst Saint-Simon declares in contrast that industrial labour as such is the essence, and now also aspires to the exclusive rule of the industrialists and the improvement of the workers condition. Finally, communism is the positive expression of annulled private property-at first as universal private property. By embracing this relation as a whole, communism is:  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (1) In its first form only a generalization and consummation of this relationship. It shows itself as such in a two fold form: on the one hand, the dominion of material property bulks so large that it wants to destroy everything which is not capable of being possessed by all as private property. It wants to abstract by force from talent, etc. For it the sole purpose of life and existence is direct, physical possession. The category of labourer is not done away with, but extended to all men. The relationship of private property persists as the relationship of the community to the world of things. Finally, this movement of counter posing universal private property to private property finds expression in the bestial form of counter posing to marriage (certainly a form of exclusive private property) the contmunity of women, in which a woman becomes a piece of communal and common property. It may be said that this idea of the community of women gives away the secret of this as yet completely crude and thoughtless communism. Just as the woman passes from marriage to general prostitution,7 so the entire world of wealth (that is, of man\'s objective substance) passes from the relationship of exclusive marriage with the owner of private property to a state of universal prostitution with the community. In negating the personality of man in every sphere, this type of communism is really nothing but the logical expression of private property, which is this negation. General envy constituting itself as a power is the disguise in which avarice re-establishes itself and satisfies itself, only in another way. The thoughts of every piece of private property-inherent in each piece as such-are at least turned against all wealthier private property in the form of envy and the urge to reduce to a common level, so that this envy and urge even constitute the essence of competition. The crude communism is only the consummation of this envy and of this levelling-down proceeding from the preconceived minimum. It has a definite, limited standard. How little this annulment of private property is really an appropriation is in fact proved by the abstract negation of the entire world of culture and civilization, the regression to the unnatural simplicity of the poor and undemanding man who has not only failed to go beyond private property, but has not yet even attained to it.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The community is only a community of labour, and an equality of wages paid out by the communal capital-the community as the universal capitalist. Both sides of the relationship are raised to an imagined- universality-labour as a state in which every person is put, and capital as the acknowledged universality and power of the community.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In the approach to woman as the spoil and handmaid of communal lust is expressed the infinite degradation in which man exists for himself, for the secret of this approach has its unambiguous, decisive, plain and undisguised expression in the relation of man to woman and in the manner in which the direct and natural procreative relationship is conceived. The direct, natural, and necessary relation of person to person is the relation of man to woman. In this natural relationship of the sexes man\'s relation to nature is immediately his relation to man, just as his relation to man is immediately his relation to nature-his own natural function. In this relationship, therefore, is sensuously manifested, reduced to an observable fact, the extent to which the human essence has become nature to man, or to which nature has to him become the human essence of man. From this relationship one can therefore judge man\'s whole level of development. It follows from the character of this relationship how much man as a species being, as man, has come to be himself and to comprehend himself; the relation of man to woman is the most natural relation of human being to human being. It therefore reveals the extent to which man\'s natural behaviour has become human, or the extent to which the human essence in him has become a natural essence-the extent to which his human nature has come to be nature to him. In this relationship is revealed, too, the extent to which man\'s need has hecome a human need; the extent to which, therefore, the other person as a person has become for him a need-the extent to which he in his individual existence is at the same time a social being. The first positive annulment of private property-crude communism-is thus merely one form in which the vileness of private property, which wants to set itself up as the positive community, comes to the surface.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (2) Communism (a) of a political nature still-democratic or despotic; (b) with the annulment of the state, yet still incomplete, and being still affected by private property (i.e., by the estrangement of man). In both forms communism already knows itself to be re-integration or return of man to himself, the transcendence of human self-estrangement; but since it has not yet grasped the positive essence of private property, and just as little the human nature of need, it remains captive to it and infected by it. It has, indeed, grasped its concept, but not its essence.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (3) Communism as the positive transcendence of private property, or human self-estrangement, and therefore as the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man; communism therefore as the complete return of man to himself as a social (i.e., human) being-a return become conscious, and accomplished within the entire wealth of previous development. This communism, as fully-developed naturalism, equals humanism, and as fully-developed humanism equals naturalism; it is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man-the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The entire movement of history is, therefore, both its actual act of genesis (the birth act of its empirical existence) and also for its thinking consciousness the comprehended and known process of its coming-to-be. That other, still immature communism, meanwhile, seeks an historical proof for itself-a proof in the realm of the existent-amongst disconnected historical phenomena opposed to private property, tearing single phases from the historical process and focussing attention on them as proofs of its historical pedigree (a horse ridden hard especially by Cabet, Villegardelle, etc.). By so doing it simply makes clear that by far the greater part of this proc¬ess contradicts its claims, and that, if it has once been, precisely its being in the past refutes its pretension to being essential.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0That the entire revolutionary movement necessarily finds both its empirical and its theoretical basis in the movement of private property-in that of the economy, to be precise-is easy to see.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0This material, immediately sensuous private property is the material sensuous expression of estranged human life. Its movement production and consumption-is the sensuous revelation of the movement of all production hitherto-i.e., the realization or the reality of man. Religion, family, state, law, morality, science, art, etc., are only particular modes of production, and fall under its general law. The positive transcendence of private property as the appropriation of human life is, therefore, the positive transcendence of all estrangement-that is to say, the return of man from religion, family, state, etc., to this human, i.e., social made of existence. Religious estrangement as such occurs only in the realm of consciousness, of man\'s inner life, but economic estrangement is that of real life; its transcendence therefore embraces bath aspects. It is evident that the initial stage of the movement amongst the various peoples depends an whether the true and for them authentic life of the people manifests itself more in consciousness or in the external world-is mare ideal or real. Communism begins from the outset (Owen) with atheism; but atheism is at first far from being communism; indeed, it is still mostly an abstraction.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The philanthropy of atheism is therefore at first only philosophical, abstract, philanthropy, and that of communism is at once real and directly bent an action.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We have seen haw an the premise of positively annulled private property man produces man-himself and the other man; haw the object, being the direct embodiment of his individuality, is simultaneously his awn existence far the other man, the existence of the other man, and that existence far him. Likewise, however, bath the material of labour and man as the subject, are the paint of departure as well as the result of the movement (and precisely in this fact, that they must constitute the point of departure, lies the historical necessity of private property). Thus the social character is the general character of the whale movement: just as society itself produces man as man, So is society produced by him. Activity and consumption, bath in their content and in their mode of existence, are social: social activity and social consumption; the human essence of nature first exists only far social man; for only here does nature exist far him as a bond with man-as his existence for the other and the other\'s existence for him-as the life-element of the human world; only here does nature exist as the foundation of his own human existence. Only here has what is to him his natural existence became his human existence, and nature became man for him. Thus society is the consummated oneness in substance of man and nature-the true resurrection of nature-the naturalism of man and the humanism of nature bath brought to fulfilment.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Social activity and social consumption exist by no means only in the farm of same directly communal activity and directly communal consumption, although communal activity and communal consumption-i.e., activity and consumption which are manifested and directly confirmed in real association with other men-will occur wherever such a direct expression of sociality stems from the true character of the activity\'s content and is adequate to the nature of consumption.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But again when I am active scientifically, etc.,-when I am engaged in activity which I can seldom perform in direct community with others-then I am social, because I am active as a man. Not only is the material of my activity given to me as a social product (as is even the language in which the thinker is active): my own, existence is social activity, and therefore that which I make of myself, I make of myself for society and with the consciousness of myself as a social being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0My general consciousness is only the theoretical shape of that of which the living shape is the real community, the social fabric, although at the present day general consciousness is an abstraction from real life and as such antagonistically confronts it. Consequently, too, the activity of my general consciousness, as an activity, is my theoretical existence as a social being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0What is to be avoided above all is the re-establishing of ""Society"" as an abstraction vis-à-vis the individual. The individual is the social being. His life, even if it may not appear in the direct form of a communal life carried out together with others-is therefore an expression and confirmation of social life. Man\'s individual and species life are not different, however much-and this is inevitable-the mode of existence of the individual is a more particular, or more general mode of the life of the species, or the life of the species is a more particular or more general individual life.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In his consciousness of species man confirms his real social life and simply repeats his real existence in thought, just as conversely the being of the species confirms itself in species-consciousness and is for itself in its generality as a thinking being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Man, much as he may therefore be a particular individual (and it is precisely his particularity which makes him an individual, and a real individual social being) , is just as much the totality-the ideal totality-the subjective existence of thought and experienced society present for itself; just as he exists also in the real world as the awareness and the real enjoyment of social existence, and as a totality of human life-activity.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thinking and being are thus no doubt distinct, but at the same time they are in unity with each other.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Death seems to be a harsh victory of the species over the definite individual and to contradict their unity. But the determinate individual is only a determinate species being, and as such mortal.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (4) Just as private property is only the sensuous expression of the fact that man becomes objective for himself and at the same time becomes to himself a strange and inhuman object; just as it expresses the fact that the assertion of his life is the alienation of his life, that his realization is his loss of reality, is an alien reality: conversely, the positive transcendence of private property-i.e., the sensuous appropriation for and by man of the human essence and of human life, of objective man, of human achievements-is not to be conceived merely in the sense of direct, one-sided gratification-merely in the sense of possessing, of having. Man appropriates his total essence in a total manner, that is to say, as a whole man. Each of his human relations to the world-seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking, being aware, sensing, wanting, acting, loving-in short, all the organs of his individual being, like those organs which are directly social in their form, are in their objective orientation or in their orientation to the object, the appropriation of that object, the appropriation of the human world; their orientation to the object is the manifestation of the human world;8 it is human efficaciousness and human suffering, for suffering, apprehended humanly, is an enjoyment of self in man.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Private property has made us so stupid and one-sided that an object is only ours when we have it-when it exists for us as capital, or when it is directly possessed, eaten, drunk, worn, inhabited, etc.,-in short, when it is used by us. Although private property itself again conceives all these direct realizations of possession as means of life, and the life which they serve as means is the life of private property-labour and conversion into capital.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In place of all these physical and mental senses there has therefore come the sheer estrangement of all these senses-the sense of having. The human being had to be reduced to this absolute poverty in order that he might yield his inner wealth to the outer world. ( On the category of ""having,"" see Hess in the Twenty-One Sheets. )  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The transcendence of private property is therefore the complete emancipation of all human senses and attributes; but it is this emancipation precisely because these senses and attributes have become, subjectively and objectively, human. The eye has become a human eye, just as its object has become a social, human object-an object emanating from man for man. The senses have therefore become directly in their practice theoreticians. They relate themselves to the thing for the sake of the thing, but the thing itself is an objective human relation to itself and to man,9and vice versa. Need or enjoyment have consequently lost their egotistical nature, and nature has lost its mere utility by use becoming human use.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In the same way, the senses and enjoyments of other men have become my own appropriation. Besides these direct organs, therefore, social organs develop in the form of society; thus, for instance, activity in direct association with others, etc., has become an organ for expressing my own life, and a mode of appropriating human life.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It is obvious that the human eye gratifies itself in a way different from the crude, non•human eye; the human ear different from the crude ear, etc.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0To recapitulate; man is not lost in his object only when the object becomes for him a human object or objective man. This is possible only when the object becomes for him a social object, he himself for himself a social being, just as society becomes a being for him in this object.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0On the one hand, therefore, it is only when the objective world becomes everywhere for man in society the world of man\'s essential powers1-human reality, and for that reason the reality of his own essential powers-that all objects become for him the objectification of himself, become objects which confirm and realize his individuality, become his objects: that is, man himself becomes the object. The manner in which they become his depends on the nature of the objects and on the nature of the essential power corresponding to it; for it is precisely the determinateness of this relationship which shapes the particular, real mode of affirmation. To the eye an object comes to be other than it is to the ear, and the object of the eye is another object than the object of the ear. The peculiarity of each essential power is precisely its peculiar essence, and therefore also the peculiar mode of its objectification, of its objectively actual living being. Thus man is affirmed in the objective world not only in the act of thinking, but with all his senses.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0On the other hand, looking at this in its subjective aspect: just as music alone awakens in man the sense of music, and just as the most beautiful music has no sense for the unmusical ear-is no object for it, because my object can only be the confirmation of one of my essential powers and can therefore only be so for me as my essential power is present for itself as a subjective capacity, because the sense of an object for me goes only so far as my senses go (has only sense for a sense corresponding to that object) -for this reason the senses of the social man are other senses than those of the non-social man. Only through the objectively unfolded richness of man\'s essential being is the richness of subjective human sensibility (a musical ear, an eye for beauty of form-in short, senses capable of human gratifications, senses confirming themselves as essential powers of man ) either cultivated or brought into being. For not only the five senses but also the so-called mental senses-the practical senses (will, love, etc. )-in a word, human sense-the humanness of the senses-comes to be by virtue of its object, by virtue of humanized nature. The forming of the five senses is a labour of the entire history of the world down to the present.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The sense caught up in crude practical need has only a restricted sense. For the starving man, it is not the human form of food that exists, but only its abstract being as food; •it could just as well be there in its crudest form, and it would be impossible to say wherein this feeding-activity differs from that of animals. The care-burdened man in need has no sense for the finest play; the dealer in minerals sees only the mercantile value but not the beauty and the unique nature of the mineral: he has no mineralogical sense. Thus, the objectification of the human essence both in its theoretical and practical aspects is required to make man\'s sense human, as well as to create the human sense corresponding to the entire wealth of human and natural substance.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Just as resulting from the movement of private property, of its wealth as well as its poverty-or of its material and spiritual wealth and poverty-the budding society finds to hand all the material for this development: so established society produces man in this entire richness of his being-produces the rich man profoundly endowed with all the senses-as its enduring reality.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It will be seen how subjectivism and objectivism, spiritualism and materialism, activity and suffering, only lose their antithetical character, and thus their existence, as such antitheses in the social condition; it will be seen how the resolution of the theoretical antitheses is only possible  way, by virtue of the practical energy of men . Their resolution is therefore by no means merely, a problem of knowledge, but a real problem of life, which philosophy could not solve precisely because it conceived this problem as merely a theoretical one.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It will be seen how the history of industry and the established objective existence of industry are the open book of man\'s essential powers, the exposure to the senses of human psychology. Hitherto this was not conceived in its inseparable connection with man\'s essential being, but only in an external relation of utility, because, moving in the realm of estrangement, people could only think man\'s general mode of being-religion or history in its abstract general character as politics, art, literature, etc.,-to be the realityof man\'s essential powers and man\'s species-activity. We have before us the objectified essential powers of man in the form of sensuous, alien, useful objects, in the form of estrangement, displayed in ordinary material industry (which can be conceived as a part of that general movement, just as that movement can be conceived as a particular part of industry, since all human activity hitherto has been labour-that is, industry-activity estranged from itself).  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0A psychology for which this, the part of history most contemporary and accessible to sense, remains a closed book, cannot become a genuine, comprehensive and real science. What indeed are we to think of a science which airily abstracts from this large part of human labour and which fails to feel its own incompleteness, while such a wealth of human endeavour unfolded before it means nothing more to it than, perhaps, what can be expressed in one word-""need, "" ""vulgar need""?  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The natural sciences have developed an enormous activity and have accumulated a constantly growing mass of material. Philosophy, however, has remained just as alien to them as they remain to philosophy. Their momentary unity was only a chimerical illusion. The will was there, but the means were lacking. Even historiography pays regard to natural science only occasionally, as a factor of enlightenment and utility arising from individual great discoveries. But natural science has invaded and transformed human life all the more practically through the medium of industry; and has prepared human emancipation, however directly and much it had to consummate dehumanization. Industry is the actual, historical relation of nature, and therefore of natural science, to man. If, therefore, industry is conceived as the exoteric revelation of man\'s essential powers, we also gain an understanding of the human essence of nature or the natural essence of man. In consequence, natural science will lose its abstractly material-or rather, its idealistictendency, and will become the basis of human science, as it has already become the basis of actual human life, albeit in an estranged form. One basis for life and another basis for science is a priori a lie. The nature which comes to be in human history-the genesis of human society-is man\'s real nature; hence nature as it comes to be through industry, even though in an estranged form, is true anthropological nature.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Sense-perception ( see Feuerbach) must be the basis of all science. Only when it proceeds from sense-perception in the twofold form both of sensuous consciousness and of sensuous need-that is, only when science proceeds from nature-is it true science. All history is the preparation for ""man"" to become the object of sensuous consciousness, and for the needs of ""man as man"" to become  needs. History itself is a real part of natural history-of nature\'s coming to be man. Natural science will in time subsume under itself the science of man, just as the science of man will subsume under itself natural science: there will be one science.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Man is the immediate object of natural science: for immediate, sensuous nature for man is, immediately, human sensuousness (the expressions are identical ) -presented immediately in the form of the other man sensuously present for him. For his own sensuousness first exists as human sensuousness for himself through the other man. But nature is the immediate object of the science of man: the first object of man-man-is nature, sensuousness; and the particular human sensuous essential powers can only find their self-knowledge in the science of the natural world in general, since they can find their objective realization in natural objects only. The element of thought itself-the element of thought\'s living expression-language-is of a sensuous nature. The social reality of nature, and human natural science, or the natural science about man, are identical terms.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It will be seen how in place of the wealth and poverty of political economy come the rich human being and rich human need. The rich human being is simultaneously the human being in need of a totality of human life activities-the man in whom his own realization exists as an inner necessity, as need. Not only wealth, but likewise the poverty of man-given socialism-receives in equal measure a human and therefore social significance. Poverty is the passive bond which causes the human being to experience the need of the- greatest wealth-the other human being. The dominion of the objective being in me, the sensuous outburst of my essential activity, is emotion, which thus becomes here the activity of my being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (5) A being only considers himself independent when he stands on his own feet; and he only stands on his own feet when he owes his existence to himself. A man who lives by the grace of another regards himself as a dependent being. But I live completely by the grace of another if owe him not only the sustenance of my life, but if he has, moreover, created my life-if he is the source of my life; and if it is not of my own creation, my life has necessarily a source of this kind outside it. The Creation is therefore an idea very difficult to dislodge from popular consciousness. The self¬mediated being of nature and of man is incomprehensible to it, because it contradicts everything palpable in practical life.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The creation of the earth has received a mighty blow from geogen -i.e., from the science which presents the formation of the earth, the coming-to-be of the earth, as a process, as self-generation. Generatio aequivoca2 is the only practical refutation of the theory of creation.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Now it is certainly easy to say to the single individual what Aristotle has already said. You have been begotten by your father and your mother; therefore in you the mating of two human beings-a species-act of human beings-has produced the human being. You see, therefore, that even physically, man owes his existence to man. Therefore you must not only keep sight of the one aspect-the infinite progression which leads you further to enquire: ""Who begot my father? Who his grandfather?"", etc. You must also hold on to the circular movement sensuously perceptible in that progression, by which man repeats himself in procreation, thus always remaining the subject. You will reply, however: I grant you this circular movement; now grant me the progression which drives me even further until I ask: Who begot the first man, and nature as a whole? I can only answer you: Your question is itself a product of abstraction. Ask yourself how you arrived at that question. Ask yourself whether your question is not posed from a standpoint to which I cannot reply, because it is a perverse one. Ask yourself whether that progression as such exists for a reasonable mind. When you ask about the creation of nature and man, you are abstracting, in so doing, from man and nature. You postulate them as non-existent, and yet you want me to prove them to you as existing. Now I say to you: Give up your abstraction and you will also give up your question. Or if you want to hold on to your abstraction, then be consistent, and if you think of man and nature as non-existent, then think of yourself as non-existent, for you too are surely nature and man. Don\'t think, don\'t ask me, for as soon as you think and. ask, your abstraction from the existence of nature and man has no meaning. Or are you such an egoist that you postulate everything as nothing, and yet want yourself to be?  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0You can reply: I do not want to postulate the nothingness of nature. I ask you about its genesis, just as I ask the anatomist about the formation of bones, etc.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But since for the socialist man the entire so-called history of the world  is nothing but the begetting of man through human labour, nothing but the coming-to-be of nature for man, he has the visible, irrefutable proof of his birth through himself, of his process of coming-to-be. Since the real existence of man and nature has become practical, sensuous and perceptible-since man has become for man as the being of nature, and nature for man as the being of man-the question about an alien being , about a being above nature and man-a question which implies the admission of the inessentiality of nature and of man-has become impossible in practice. Atheism, as the denial of this inessentiality, has no longer any meaning, for atheism is a negation of God, and postulates the existence of man through this negation; but socialism as socialism no longer stands in any need of such a mediation. It proceeds from the practically and theoretically sensuous consciousness of man and of nature as the essence. Socialism is man\'s positive self-consciousness no longer mediated through the annulment of religion, just as real life is man\'s positive reality, no longer mediated through the annulment of private property, through communism. Communism is the position as the negation of the negation, and is hence the actual phase necessary for the next stage of historical development in the process of human emancipation and recovery. Communism is the necessary pattern and the dynamic principle of the immediate future, but communism as such is not the goal of human development-the structure of human society.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The Meaning of Human Requirements  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 We have seen what significance, given socialism, the wealth of human needs has, and what significance, therefore, both a new mode of production and a new object of production have: a new manifestation of the forces of human nature and a new enrichment of human nature.3 Under private property their significance is reversed: every person speculates on creating a new need in another, so as to drive him to a fresh sacrifice, to place him in a new depend¬ence and to seduce him into a new mode of gratification and therefore economic ruin. Each tries to establish over the other an alien power, so as thereby to find satisfaction .of his own selfish need. The increase in the quantity of objects is accompanied by an extension of the realm of the alien powers to which man is subjected, and every new product represents a new potency of mutual swindling and mutual plundering. Man becomes ever poorer as man; his need for money becomes ever greater if he wants to overpower hostile being; and the power of his money declines exactly in inverse proportion to the increase in the volume of production: that is, his neediness grows as the power of money increases.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The need for money is therefore the true need produced by the modern economic system, and it is the only need which the latter produces. The quantity of money becomes to an ever greater degree its sole effective attribute: just as it reduces everything to its abstract form, so it reduces itself in the course of its own movement to something merely quantitative. Excess and intemperance come to be its true norm. Subjectively, this is even partly manifested in that the extension of products and needs falls into contriving and ever¬calculating subservience to inhuman, refined, unnatural and imaginary appetites.Private property does not know how to change crudeneed into human need. Its idealism is fantasy, caprice and whim; and no eunuch flatters his despot more basely or uses more despicable means to stimulate his dulled capacity for pleasure in order to sneak a favour for himself than does the industrial eunuch-the producer-in order to sneak for himself a few pennies-in order to charm the golden birds out of the pockets of his Christianly beloved neighbours. He puts himself at the service of the other\'s most depraved fancies, plays the pimp between him and his need, excites in him morbid appetites, lies in wait for each of his weaknesses-all so that he can then demand the cash for this service of love. (Every product is a bait with which to seduce away the other\'s very being, his money; every real and possible need is a weakness which will lead the fly to the gluepot. General exploitation of communal human nature, just as every imperfection in man, is a bond with heaven-an avenue giving the priest access to his heart; every need is an opportunity to approach one\'s neighbour under the guise of the utmost amiability and to say to him: Dear friend, I give you what you need, but you know the conditio sine qua non; you know the ink in which you have to sign yourself over to me; in providing for your pleasure, I fleece you.)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0And partly, this estrangement manifests itself in that it produces refinement of needs and of their means on the one hand, and a bestial barbarization, a complete, unrefined, abstract simplicity of need, on the other; or rather in that it merely resurrects itself in its opposite. Even the need for fresh air ceases for the worker. Man returns to living in a cave, which is now, however, contaminated with the mephitic breath of plague given off by civilization, and which he continues to occupy only precariously, it being for him a n alien habitation which can be withdrawn from him any day-a place from which, if he does not pay, he can be thrown out any day. For this mortuary he has to pay. A dwelling in the light, which Prometheus in Aeschylus designated as one of the greatest boons, by means of which he made the savage into a human being, ceases to exist for the worker. Light, air, etc.-the simplest animal cleanliness-ceases to be a need for man. Dirt-this stagnation and putrefaction of man-the sewage of civilization (speaking quite literally) -comes to be the element of life for him. Utter, unnatural neglect, putre¬fied nature, comes to be his life-element. None of his senses exist any longer, and not only in his human fashion, but in an inhuman fashion, and therefore not even in an animal fashion. The crudest modes (and instruments) of human labour are coming back: the tread mill of the Roman slaves, for instance, is the means of production, the means of existence, of many English workers. It is not only that man has no human needs-even his animal needs are ceasing to exist. The Irishman no longer knows any need now but the need to eat, and indeed only the need to eat potatoes-and scabby potatoes at that, the worst kind of potatoes. But in each of their industrial towns England and France have already a little Ireland. The savage and the animal have at least the need to hunt, to roam, etc.-the need of companionship. Machine labour is simplified in order to make a worker out of the human being still in the making, the completely immature human being, the child-whilst the worker has become a neglected child. The machine accommodates itself to the weakess of the human being in order to make the weak human being into a machine.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0How the multiplication of needs and of the means of their satisfaction breeds the absence of needs and of means is demonstrated by the political economist (and the capitalist: it should be noted that it is always empirical business men we are talking about when we refer to political economists-their scientific confession and mode of being). This he shows:  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (1) By reducing the worker\'s need to the barest and most miserable level of physical subsistence, and by reducing his activity to the most abstract mechanical movement. Hence, he says: Man has no other need either of activity or of enjoyment. For he calls even this life human life and existence.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (2) By counting the lowest possible level of life (existence) as the standard, indeed as the general standard-general because it is applicable to the mass of men. He changes the worker into an insensible being lacking all needs, just as he changes his activity into a pure abstraction from all activity. To him, therefore, every luxury of the worker seems to be reprehensible, and everything that goes beyond the most abstract need-be it in the realm of passive enjoyment, or a manifestation of activity-seems to him a luxury. Political economy, this science of wealth, is therefore simultaneously the science of denial, of want, of thrift, of saving-and it actually reaches the point where it spares man the need of either fresh air or physical exercise. This science of marvellous industry is simultaneously the science of asceticism, and its true ideal is the ascetic but extortionate miser and the ascetic but productive slave. Its moral ideal is the worker who takes part of his wages to the savings-bank, and it has even found ready-made an abject art in which to clothe this its pet idea: they have presented it, bathed in sentimentality, on the stage. Thus political economy-despite its worldly and wanton appearance-is a true moral science, the most moral of all the sciences. Self-denial, the denial of life and of all human needs, is its cardinal doctrine. The less you eat, drink and read books; the less you go to the theatre, the dance, hall, the public¬house; the less you think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save-the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor dust will devour-your capital. The less you are, the more you have; the less you express your own life, the greater is your alienated life-the greater is the store of your estranged being. Everything which the political economist takes from you in life and in humanity, he replaces for you in money and in wealth; and all the things which you cannot do, your money can do. It can eat and drink, go to the dance hall and the theatre; it can travel, it can appropriate art, learning, the treasures of the past, political power -all this it can appropriate for you-it can buy all this for you: it is the true endowment. Yet being all this, it is inclined to do nothing but create itself, buy itself; for everything else is after all its servant. And when I have the master I have the servant and do not need his servant. All passions and all activity must therefore be submerged in avarice. The worker may only have enough for him to want to live, and may only want to live in order to have .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Of course a controversy now arises in the field of political economy. The one side (Lauderdale, Malthus, etc.) recommends luxury and execrates thrift. The other (Say, Ricardo, etc.) recommends thrift and execrates luxury. But the former admits that it wants luxury in order to produce labour (i.e., absolute thrift); and the latter admits that it recommends thrift in order to produce wealth (i.e., luxury). The Lauderdale-Malthus school has the romantic notion that avarice alone ought not to determine the consumption of the rich, and it contradicts its own laws in advancing extravagance as a direct means of enrichment. Against it, therefore, the other side very earnestly and circumstantially proves that I do not increase but reduce my possessions by being extravagant. The Say¬Ricardo school, however, is hypocritical in not admitting that it is precisely whim and caprice which determine production. It forgets the ""refined needs""; it forgets that there would be no production without consumption; it forgets that as a result of competition production can only become more extensive and luxurious. It forgets that it is use that determines a thing\'s value, and that fashion determines use. It wishes to see only ""useful things"" produced, but it forgets that production of too many useful things produces too large a useless population. Both sides forget that extravagance and thrift, luxury and privation, wealth and poverty are equal.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0And you must not only stint the immediate "",ratification of your senses, as by stinting yourself of food, etc.: you must also spare yourself all sharing of general interest, all sympathy, all trust, etc.; if you want to be economical, if you do not want to be ruined by illusions.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0You must make everything that is yours saleable, i.e., useful. If I ask the political economist: Do I obey economic laws if I extract money by offering my body for sale, by surrendering it to another\'s lust? (The factory workers in France call the prostitution of their wives and daughters the xth working hour, which is literally correct. ) -Or am I not acting in keeping with political economy if I sell my friend to the Moroccans? ( And the direct sale of men in the form of a trade in conscripts, etc., takes place in all civilized countries.) -Then the political economist replies to me: You do not transgress my laws; but see what Cousin Ethics and Cousin Religion have to say about it. My political economic ethics and religion have nothing to reproach you with, but- But whom am I now to believe, political economy or ethics? The ethics of political economy is acquisition, work, thrift, sobriety-but political economy promises to satisfy my needs. The political economy of ethics is the opulence of a good conscience, of virtue, etc.; but how can I live virtuously if I do not live? And how can I have a good conscience if I am not conscious of anything? It stems from the very nature of estrangement that each sphere applies to me a different and opposite yard¬stick-ethics one and political economy another; for each is a specific estrangement of man and focuses attention on a particular round of estranged essential activity, and each stands in an estranged relation to the other. Thus M. Michel Chevalier reproaches Ricardo with having abstracted from ethics. But Ricardo is allowing political economy to speak its own language, and if it does not speak ethically, this is not Ricardo\'s fault. M. Chevalier abstracts from political economy in so far as he moralizes, but he really and necessarily abstracts from ethics in so far as he practises political economy. The reference of political economy to ethics, if it is other than an arbitrary, contingent and therefore unfounded and unscientific reference, if it is not being put up as a sham but is meant to be essential, can only be the reference of the laws of polit¬ical economy to ethics. If there is no such connection, or if the contrary is rather the case, can Ricardo help it? Besides, the opposition between political economy and ethics is only a sham opposition and just as much no opposition as it is an opposition. All that happens is that political economy expresses moral laws in its own way.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Needlessness as the principle of political economy is most brilliantly shown in its theory of population. There are too many people. Even the existence of men is a pure luxury; and if the worker is ""ethical,"" he will be sparing in procreation. ( Mill suggests public acclaim for those who prove themselves continent in their sexual relations, and public rebuke for those who sin against such barrenness of marriage.... Is not this the ethics, the teaching of asceticism?) The production of people appears in the form of public misery.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The meaning which production has in relation to the rich is seen revealed in the meaning which it has for the poor. At the top themanifestation is always refined, veiled, ambiguous-a sham; lower, it is rough, straightforward, frank-the real thing. The worker\'s crude need is a far greater source of gain than the refined need of the rich. The cellar-dwellings in London bring more to those who let them than do the palaces; that is to say, with reference to the landlord they constitute greater wealth, and thus (to speak the language of political economy) greater social wealth.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Industry speculates on the refinement of needs, but it speculates just as much on their crudeness, but on their artificially produced crudeness, whose true enjoyment, therefore, is self-stupefaction¬this seeming satisfaction of need-this civilization contained within the crude barbarism of need; the English gin-shops are therefore the symbolical embodiments of private property. Their luxury reveals the true relation of industrial luxury and wealth to man. They are therefore rightly the only Sunday pleasures of the people, dealt with at least mildly by the English police.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We have already seen how the political economist establishes the unity of labour and capital in a variety of ways:- (1) Capital is accumulated labour. (2) The purpose of capital within production -partly, reproduction of capital with profit, partly, capital as raw material ( material of labour) , and partly, as itself a working instrument (the machine is capital directly equated with labour)-is productive labour. (3) The worker is a capital. (4) Wages belong to costs of capital. (5) In relation to the worker, labour is the reprod¬uction of his life-capital. (6) In relation to the capitalist, labour is an aspect of his capital\'s activity.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Finally, (7) the political economist postulates the original unity of capital and labour in the form of the unity of the capitalist and the worker; this is the original state of paradise. The way in which these two aspects in the form of two persons leap at each other\'s throats is for the political economist a contingent event, and hence only to be explained by reference to external factors. (See Mill.) 4  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The nations which are still dazzled by the sensuous splendour of precious metals, and are therefore still fetish-worshippers of metal money, are -not yet fully developed money-nations.-Contrast of France and England. The extent to which the solution of theoreti¬cal riddles is the task of practice and effected through practice, just as true practice is the condition of a real and positive theory, is shown, for example, in fetishism. The sensuous consciousness of the fetish-worshipper is different from that of the Greek, because his sensuous existence is still different. The abstract enmity between sense and spirit is necessary so long as the human feeling for nature, the human sense of nature, and therefore also the natural sense of man, are not yet produced by man\'s own labour.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Equality is nothing but a translation of the German ""Ich=Ich"" into the French, i.e., political form. Equality as the groundwork of communism is its political justification, and it is the same as when the German justifies it by conceiving man as universal self-consciousness. Naturally, the transcendence of the estrangement always proceeds from that form of the estrangement which is the dominant power: in Germany, self-consciousness; in France, equality, because politics; in England, real, material, practical need taking only itself as its standard. It is from this standpoint that Proudhon is to be criticized and appreciated.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If we characterize communism itself because of its character as negation of the negation, as the appropriation of the human essence which mediates itself with itself through the negation of private property-as being not yet the true, self-originating position but rather a position originating from private property, 5  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Since in that case8 the real estrangement of the life of man remains, and remains all the more, the more one is conscious of it as such, it may be accomplished solely by putting communism into operation.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In order to abolish the idea of private property, the idea of communism is completely sufficient. It takes actual communist action to abolish actual private property. History will come to it; and this movement, which in theory we already know to be a self-transcending movement, will constitute in actual fact a very severe and protracted process. But we must regard it as a real advance to have gained beforehand a consciousness of the limited character as well as of the goal of this historical movement-and a consciousness which reaches out beyond it.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0When communist workmen associate with one another, theory, propaganda, etc., is their first end. But at the same time, as a result of this association, they acquire a new need-the need for society -and what appears as a means becomes an end. You can observe this practical process in its most splendid results whenever you see French socialist workers together. Such things as smoking, drinking, eating, etc., are no longer means of contact or means that bring together. Company, association, and conversation, which again has society as its end, are enough for them; the brotherhood of man isno mere phrase with them, but a fact of life, and the nobility of man shines upon us from their work-h ardened bodies .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0When political economy claims that demand and supply always balance each other, it immediately forgets that according to its own claim ( theory of population ) the supply of people always exceeds the demand, and that, therefore, in the essential result of the whole production process-the existence of man-the disparity between demand and supply gets its most striking expression.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The extent to which money, which appears as a means, constitutes true power and the sale end-the extent to which in general that means which gives me substance, which gives me possession of the objective substance of others, is an end in itself-can be clearly seen from the facts that landed p roperty wherever land is the source of life, and horse and sword wherever these are the true means of life, are also acknowledged as the true political powers in life. In the middle ages a social class is emancipated as soon as it is allowed to carry the sword. Amongst nomadic peoples it is the horse which makes me a free man and a participant in the life of the community.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We have said above that man is regressing to the cave dwelling etc.-but that he is regressing to it in an estranged, malignant form. The savage in his cave-a natural element which freely offers itself for his use and protection-feels h imself no more a stranger, or rather feels himself to be just as much at home as a fish in water. But the cellar-dwelling of the poor man is a hostile dwelling, ""an alien, restraining power which only gives itself up to him in so far as he gives up to it his blood and sweat""-a dwelling which he cannot look upon as his own home where he might at last exclaim, "" Here I am at home,"" but where instead he finds himself in someone else\'s house, in the house of a stranger who daily lies in wait for him and throws him out if he does not pay his rent. Similarly, he is also aware of the contrast in quality between his dwelling and a human dwelling-a residence in that other world, the heaven of wealth.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Estrangement is manifested not only in the fact that my means of life belong to someone else, that my desire is the inaccessible possession of another, but also in the fact that everything is in itself something different from itself-that my activity is something else and that, finally ( and this applies also to the capitalist ) , all is under the sway of inhuman power. There is a form of inactive, extrava-gant wealth given over wholly to pleasure, the enjoyer of which on the one hand behaves as a mere ephemeral individual frantically spending himself to no purpose knows the slave-labour of others (human sweat and blood) as the p rey of his cupidity, and therefore knows man himself, and hence also his own self, as a sacrificed and empty being. With such wealth the contempt of man makes its appearance, partly as arrogance and as the throwing-away of whatcan give sustenance to a hundred human lives, and partly as the infamous illusion that his own unbridled extravagance and ceaseless, unproductive consumption is the condition of the other\'s labour and therefore of his subsistence. He knows the realization of the essential powers of man only as the realization of his own excesses, his whims and capricious, bizarre notions. This wealth which, on the other hand, again knows wealth as a mere means, as something that is good for nothing but to be annihilated and which is therefore at once slave and master, at once generous and mean, capricious, preumptuous, conceited, refined, cultured and witty-this wealth has not yet experienced wealth as an utterly alien power  over itself: it sees in it, rather, only its own power, and not wealth but gratification 7final aim and end.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 * * *  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Society, as it appears to the political economist, is civil society, in which every individual is a totality of needs and only exists for the other person, as the other exists for him, in so far as each becomes a means for the other. The political economist reduces everything ( just as does politics in its Rights of Man) to man, i.e., to the individual whom he strips of all determinateness so as to class him as capitalist or worker. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The division of labour is the expression in political economy of the social character of labour within the estrangement. Or, since labour is only an expression of human activity within alienation, of the living of life as the alienating of life, the division of labour, too, is therefore nothing else but the estranged, alienated positing of human activity as a real activity of the species or as activity of man as a species being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0As for the essence of the division of labour-and of course the division of labour had to be conceived as a major driving force in the production of wealth as soon as labour was recognized as the essence of private property-i.e., about the estranged and alienated form of human activity as an activity of the species-the political economists are very unclear and self-contradictory about it.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 * * *  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  The Power of Money in Bourgeois Society  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 If man\'s feelings, passions, etc., are not merely anthropological phenomena in the  8 sense, but truly ontological affirmations o-f essential being ( of nature ) , and if they are only really affirmed because their object exists for them as an object of sense, then it is clear:  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (1) That they have by no means merely one mode of affirma¬tion, but rather that the distinctive character of their existence, of their life, is constituted by the distinctive mode of their affirmation. In what manner the object exists for them, is the characteristic mode of their gratification.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (2) Whenever the sensuous affirmation is the direct annulment of the object in its independent form (as in eating, drinking, working up of the object, etc. ), this is the affirmation of the object.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (3) In so far as man, and hence also his feeling, etc., are human, the affirmation of the object by another is likewise his own enjoyment.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (4) Only through developed industry-i.e., through the medium of private property-does the ontological essence cif human passion come to be both in its totality and in its humanity; the science of man is therefore itself a product of man\'s establishment of himself by practical activity.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (5) The meaning of private property-liberated from its estrangement-is the existence of essential objects for man, both as objects of enjoyment and as objects of activity.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 By possessing the property of buying everything, by possessing the property of appropriating all objects, money is thus the object of eminent possession. The universality of its property is the omnipotence of its being. It therefore functions as the almighty being. Money is the pimp between man\'s need and the object, between his life and his means of life. But that which mediates my life for me, also mediates the existence of other people for me. For me it is the other person.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  ""What, man! confound it, hands and feet \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 And head and backside, all are yours ! \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  And what we take while life is sweet, \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Is that to be declared not ours? \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Six stallions, say, I can afford, \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Is not their strength my property? \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0I tear along, a sporting lord, \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0As if their legs belonged to me."" \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ( Mephistopheles, in Faust) 9 Shakespeare in Timon of Athens: \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  "" Gold?

To understand him, let us begin, first of all, by expounding the passage from Goethe.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0That which is for me through the medium of money-that for which I can pay (i.e., which money can buy ) -that am I, the possessor of the money. The extent of the power of money is the extent of my power. Money\'s properties a re my properties and essential powers-the properties and powers of its possessor. Thus, what I am and am capable of is by no means determined by my individuality. I am ugly, but I can buy for myself the most beautiful of women. Therefore I am not ugly, for the effect of ugliness-its deterrent power-is nullified by money. I,  in my character as an, individual, am lame, but money furnishes me with twentyfour feet . Therefore I am not lame. I am bad, dishonest, unscrupulous, stupid; but money is honoured, and therefore so is its possessor. Money is the supreme good, therefore its possessor is good. Money, besides, saves me the trouble of being dishonest: I am therefore presumed honest. I am stupid, but money is the real  mind of all things and how then should its possessor be stupid? Besides, he can buy talented people for himself, and is he who has power over the talented not more talented than the talented? Do not I, who thanks to money am capable of all that the human heart longs for, possess all human capacities? Does not my money therefore transform all my incapacities into their contrary?  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If money is the bond binding me to human life, binding society to me, binding me and nature and man, is not money the bond of all bonds? Can it not dissolve and bind all ties? Is it not, therefore, the universal agent of divorce? It is the true agent of divorce as well as the true binding agent-the 3galvano-chemical power of Society.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Shakespeare stresses especially two properties of money: (1) It is the visible divinity-the transformation of all human and natural properties into their contraries, the universal confounding and overturning of things : it makes brothers of impossibilities. (2) It is the common whore, the common pimp of people and nations.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The overturning and confounding of all human and natural qualities, the fraternization of impossibilities-the divine power of money-lies in its character as men\'s estranged, alienating and self-disposing species-nature. Money is the alienated ability of mankind.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0That which I am unable to do as a man, and of which therefore all my individual essential powers are incapable, I am able to do by means of money. Money thus turns each of these powers into something which in itself it is not-turns it, that is, into its contrary.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If I long for a particular dish or want to take the mail-coach because I am not strong enough to go by foot, money fetches me the dish and the mail-coach: that is, it converts my wishes from something in the realm of imagination, translates them from their meditated, imagined or willed existence into their sensuous, actual existence-from imagination to life, from imagined being into real being. In effecting this mediation, money is the truly creative power.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0No doubt demand also exists for him who has no money, but his demand is a mere thing of the imagination without effect or existence for me, for a third party, for the others, and which therefore remains for me unreal and objectless. The difference between effective demand based on money and ineffective demand based on my need, my passion, my wish, etc., is the difference between being and thinking, between the imagined which exists merely within me and the imagined as it is for me outside me as a real object.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If I have no money for travel, I have no need-that is, no real and self-realizing need-to travel. If I have the vocation for studybut no money for it, I have no vocation for study-that is, no effective, no true vocation. On the other hand, if I have really no vocation for study but have the will and the money for it, I have an effective vocation for it. Being the external, common medium and faculty for turning an image into reality and reality into a mere image (a faculty not springing from man as man or from human society as society), money transforms the real essential powers of man and nature into what are m erely abstract conceits and therefore imperfections-into tormenting chimeras-just as it transforms real imperfections and chimeras-essential powers which are really impotent, which exist only in the imagination of the individual-into real powers and faculties.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In the light of this characteristic alone, money is thus the general overturning of individualities which turns them into their contrary and adds contradictory attributes to their attributes .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Money, then, appears as this overturning power both against the individual and against the bonds of society, etc., which claim to be essences in themselves . It transforms fidelity into infidelity, love into hate, hate into l ove, virtue into vice, vice into virtue, servant into master, master into servant, idiocy into intelligence and intelligence into idiocy.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Since money, as the existing and active concept of value, confounds and exchanges all things, it is the general confounding and compounding of all things-the world upside-dawn-the confounding and compounding of all natural and human qualities.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0He who can buy bravery is brave, though a coward. As money is not exchanged for any one specific quality, for any one specific thing, or for any particular human essential power, but for the entire objective world of man and nature, from the standpoint of its possessor it therefore serves to exchange every property for every other, even contradictory, property and object: it is the fraternization of impossibilities. It makes contradictions embrace.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Assume man to be man and his relationship to the world to be a human one: then you can exchange love only for love, trust for trust, etc. If you want to enjoy art, you must be an artistically¬cultivated person; if you want to exercise influence over other people, you m ust be a person with a stimulating and encouraging effect on other people. Every one of your relations to man and to nature must be a specific expression, corresponding to the object of your will, of your real individual life. If you love without evoking love in return-that is, if your loving as loving does not produce reciprocal love; if through a living expression of yourself as a loving person you do not make yourself a loved person, then your love is impotent-a misfortune.  \xa0  \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0as a Whole  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (6) This is perhaps the place at which, by way of explaining and justifying the ideas here presented, we might offer some considerations in regard to the Hegelian dialectic generally and especially its exposition in the Phenomenology and Logic, and also, lastly, the relation to it of the modern critical movement.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 So powerful was modern German criticism\'s preoccupation with the past-so completely was it possessed in its development by its subject-matter-that there prevailed a completely uncritical attitude to the method of criticizing, together with a complete lack of awareness about the seemingly formal, but really vital question: how do we now stand as regards the Hegelian dialectic? This lack of awareness about the relationship of modern criticism to the Hegelian philosophy as a whole and especially to the Hegelian dialectic has been so great that critics like Strauss and Bruno Bauer still remain wholly within the confines of the Hegelian Logic; the former completely so and the latter at least implicitly so in his Synoptics4 (where, in opposition to Strauss, he replaces the substance of ""abstract nature"" by the ""self-consciousness"" of abstract man) and even in Christianity Discovered.5 Thus in Christianity Discovered, for example, you get:  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ""As though in positing the world, self-consciousness posits that \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 which is different from itself, and in what it posits it posits itself, \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 because it in turn annuls the difference between what it has \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 posited and itself, inasmuch as it itself has being only in the \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 positing and the movement.-How then can it not have its pur- \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 pose in this movement?"" etc.; or again: ""They"" ( the French mate- \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 rialists ) ""have not yet been able to see that it is only as the \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 movement of self-consciousness that the movement of the uni- \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 verse has actually come to be for itself, and achieved unity with \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 itself.""  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Such expressions do not even show any verbal divergence from the HegelIan approach, but on the contrary, repeat it word for word .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 How little consciousness there was in relation to the Hegelian dialectic dunng the act of criticism ( Bauer, The Synoptics), and how  little little this consciousness came into being even after the act of material criticism is proved by Bauer when, in his The Good of Freedom,6 he dismisses the brash question put by Herr Gruppe¬ \'\'What about logic now?""-by referring him to future critics.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But even now-now that Feuerbach both in his Theses in the Anecdotis and, in detail, in The Philosophy of the Future, has in principle overthrown the old dialectic and philosophy; now that that school of criticism, on the other hand, which was incapable of accomplishing this has all the same seen it accomplished and has proclaimed itself pure, resolute, absolute criticism-criticism that has come into the clear with itself; now that this criticism, in its spiritual pride, has reduced the whole process of history to the relation between the rest of the world and itself ( the rest of the world, in contrast to itself, falling under the category of ""the masses"" ) and dissolved all dogmatic antithesis into the single dogmatic antithesis of its own cleverness and the stupidity of the world-the antithesis of the critical Christ and Mankind, the rabble; now that daily and hourly it has demonstrated its own excellence against the dullness of the\'masses; now, finally, that it has proclaimed the critical Last Judgement in the shape of an announcement that the day is approaching when the whole of expiring humanity will assemble before it and be sorted by it into groups, each particular mob receiving its testimonium paupertatis;7 now that it has made known in print8 its superiority to human feelings as well as its superiority to the world, over which it sits enthroned in sublime solitude, only letting -fall from time to time from its sarcastic lips the ringing laughter of the Olympian Gods-even now, after all these delightful antics of moribund idealism in the guise of criticism (i.e., of Young-Hegelianism)-even now it has not expressed the suspicion that the time was ripe for a critical settling of accounts with the mother of Young-Hegelianism-the Hegelian dialectic-and even h ad  to say about its critical attitude towards the Feuerbachian dialectic. Criticism with a completely uncritical attitude to itself!  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Feuerbach is the only one who has a serious, critical attitude to the Hegelian dialectic and who has made genuine discoveries in this field. He is in fact the true conqueror of the old philosophy. The extent of his achievement, and the unpretentious simplicity With which he, Feuerbach, gives it to the world, stand in striking contrast to the reverse.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Feuerbach\'s great achievement is:  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (1) The proof that philosophy is nothing else but religion rendered into thoughts and thinking expounded, and that it has therefore likewise to be condemned as another form and manner of existence of the estrangement of the essence of man;  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (2) The establishment of true materialism and of real science, since Feuerbach also makes the social relationship ""of man to man"" the basic principle of the theory;  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ( 3) His opposing to the negation of the negation, which claims to be the absolute positive, the self-supporting positive, positively grounded on itself.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Feuerbach explains the Hegelian dialectic (and thereby justifies starting out from the positive, from sense-certainty) as follows:  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Hegel sets out from the estrangement of Substance ( in Logic, from the Infinite, the abstractly universal ) -from the absolute and fixed abstraction; which means, put popularly, that he sets out from religion and theology.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Secondly, he annuls the infinite, and establishes the actual, sensuous, real, finite, particular (philosophy-annulment of religion and theology).  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thirdly, he again annuls the positive and restores the abstraction, the infinite-restoration of religion and theology.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Feuerbach thus conceives the negation of the negation only as a contradiction of philosophy with itself-as the philosophy which affirms theology ( the transcendent, etc. ) after having denied it, and which it therefore affirms in opposition to itself.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The position or self-affirmation and self-confirmation contained in the negation of the negation is taken to be a position which is not yet sure of itself, which is therefore burdened with its opposite, which is doubtful of itself and therefore in need of proof, and which, therefore, is not a position establishing itself by its existence-not a position that justifies itself; hence it is directly and immediately confronted by the self-grounded position of sense-certanity.9  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But because Hegel has conceived the negation of the negation from the point of view of the positive relation inherent in it as the true and only positive, and from the point of view of the negative relation inherent in it as the only true act and self-realizing act of all being, he has only found the abstract, logical, speculative expression for the movement of history; and this historical process is not yet the real history of man-of man as a given subject, but only man\'s act of genesis-the story of man\'s origin: We shall explain both the abstract form of this process , and the difference between this process as it is in Hegel in contrast to modern criticism, that is, in contrast to the same process in Feuerbach\'s Wesen des Christentums (Essence of Christianity), or rather the critical form of this in Hegel still uncritical process.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Let us take a look at the Hegelian system.

Absolute Knowledge  Hegel\'s Encyclopaedia,2 beginning as it does with Logic, with pure speculative thought, and ending with Absolute Knowledge-with the self-conscious, self-comprehending, philosophic or absolute (i.e., superhuman) abstract mind-is in its entirety nothing but the display, the self-objectification, of the essence of the philosophic mind, and the philosophic mind is nothing but the estranged mind of the world thinking within its self-estrangement-i.e., comprehending itself abstractly. Logic ( mind\'s coin of the realm, the speculative or thought-value of man and nature-their essence grown totally indifferent to all real determinateness, and hence their unreal essence) is alienated thinking, and therefore thinking which abstracts from nature and from real man: abstract thinking. Then: The externality of this abstract thinking… nature, as it is for this abstract thinking. Nature is external to it-its self-loss; and it apprehends nature also in an external fashion, as abstract thinking-but as alienated abstract thinking. Finally, Mind, this thinking returning home to its own point of origin-the thinking which, as the anthropological, phenomenological, psychological, ethical, artistic and religious mind, is not valid for itself, until ultimately it finds itself, and relates itself to itself, as absolute knowledge in the hence absolute, i.e., abstract mind, and so receives its conscious embodiment in a mode of being corresponding to it. For its real mode of being is abstraction.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0There is a double error in Hegel.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The first emerges most clearly in the Phenomenology, the Hegelian philosophy\'s place of origin. When, for instance, wealth, state-power, etc., are understood by Hegel as entities estranged from the human being, this only happens in their form as thoughts . . . They are thought-entities, and therefore merely an estrangement of pure, i.e., abstract, philosophical thinking. The whole process therefore ends with Absolute Knowledge. It is precisely abstract thought from which these objects are estranged and which they confront with their arrogation of reality. The philosopher sets up himself (that is, one who is himself an abstract form of estranged man) as the measuring-rod of the estranged world. The whole history of the alienation-process and the whole process of the retraction of the alienation is therefore nothing but the history of the production of abstract (i.e., absolute) thought-of logical, speculative thought. The estrangement, which therefore forms the real interest of this alienation and of the transcendence of this alienation, is the opposition of in itself and for itself, of consciousness and self-consciousness, of object and subject-that is to say, .it is the opposition, within thought itself, between abstract thinking and sensuous reality or real sensuousness. All other oppositions and movements of these oppositions are but the semblance, the cloak, the exoteric shape of these oppositions which alone matter, and which constitute the meaning of these other, profane oppositions. It is not the fact that the human being objectifies himself inhumanly,in opposition to himself, but the fact that he objectifies himself in distinction from and in opposition to abstract thinking, that is the posited essence of the estrangement and the thing to be superseded.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The appropriation of man\'s essential powers, which have become objects-indeed, alien objects-is thus in the first place only an appropriation occurring in consciousness, in pure thought-i.e., in abstraction: it is the appropriation of these objects as thoughts and as movements of thought. Consequently, despite its thoroughly negative and critical appearance and despite the criticism really contained in it, which often anticipates far later development, there is already latent in the Phenomenology as a germ, a potentiality, a secret, the uncritical positivism and the equally uncritical idealism of Hegel\'s later works-that philosophic dissolution and restoration of the existing empirical world. In the second place: the vindication of the objective world for man-for example, the realization that sensuous consciousness is not an abstractly sensuous consciousness but a humanly sensuous consciousness-that religion, wealth, etc., are but the estranged world of human objectification, of man’s essential powers given over to work and that they are therefore but the path to the true human world-this appropriation or the insight into this process consequently appears in Hegel in this form, that sense, religion, state-power, etc., are spiritual entities; for only mind is the true essence of man, and the true form of mind is thinking mind, the logical, speculative mind. The humanness of nature and of the nature begotten by history-the humanness of man\'s products-appears in the form that they are products of abstract mind and as such, therefore, phases of mind-thought entities. The Phenomenology is, therefore, an occult critique-still to itself obscure and mystifying criticism; but inasmuch as it keeps steadily in view man\'s estrangement, even though man appears only in the shape of mind, there lie concealed in it all the elements of criticism, already prepared and elaborated in a manner often rising far above the Hegelian standpoint. The ""Unhappy Consciousness,"" the ""Honest Consciousness,"" the struggle of the ""Noble and Base Consciousness,"" etc.,-these separate sections contain, but still in .an estranged form, the critical elements of whole spheres such as religion, the state, civil life, etc. Just as entities, objects, appear as thought-entities, so the subject is always consciousness or self-consciousness; or rather the object appears only as abstract consciousness, man only as self-consciousness: the distinct forms of estrangement which make their appearance are, therefore, only various forms of consciousness and self-consciousness. Just as in itself abstract consciousness ( the form in which the object is conceived) is merely a moment of distinction of self-consciousness, what appears as the result of the movement is the identity of self¬consciousness with consciousness-absolute knowledge-the movement of abstract thought no longer directed outwards but going on now oniy within its own self: that is to say, the dialectic of pure thought is the result.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The outstanding thing in Hegel\'s Phenomenology and its final outcome-that is, the dialectic of negativity as the moving and generating principle-is thus first that Hegel conceives the self-genesis of man as a process, conceives objectification as loss of the object, as alienation and as transcendence of this alienation; that he thus grasps the essence of labour and comprehends objective man-true, because real man-as the outcome of man\'s own labour. The real, active orientation of man to himself as a species being, or his manifestation as a real species being ( i.e., as a human being ) , is only possible by his really bringing out of himself all the powers that are his as the species man-something which in turn is only possible through the totality of man\'s actions, as the result of history-is only possible by man\'s treating these generic powers as objects: and this, to begin with, is again only possible in the form of estrangement.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0We shall now demonstrate in detail Hegel\'s one-sidedness and limitations as they are displayed in the final chapter of the Phenomenology, ""Absolute Knowledge""-a chapter which contains the concentrated spirit of the Phenomenology, the relationship of the Phenomenology to speculative dialectic, and also Hegel\'s consciousness concerning both and their relationship to one another.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Let us provisionally say just this much in advance: Hegel\'s standpoint is that of modern political economy. He grasps labour as the essence of man-as man\'s essence in the act of proving itself: he sees only the positive, not the negative side of labour. Labour is man\'s coming to-be for himself within alienation, or as alienated man. The only labour which Hegel knows and recognizes is abstractly mental labour. Therefore, that which constitutes the essence of philosophy-the alienation of man in his knowing of himself, or alienated science thinking itself-Hegel grasps as its essence; and he is therefore able vis-à-vis preceding philosophy to gather together its separate elements and phases, and to present his philosophy as the philosophy. What the other philosophers did¬that they grasped separate phases of nature and of human life as phases of self-consciousness, and indeed of abstract self-consciousness-is known to Hegel as the doings of philosophy. Hence his science is absolute.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Let us now turn to our subject.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Absolute Knowledge. The last chapter of the ""Phenomenology.""  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The main point is that the object of consciousness is nothing else but self-consciousness, or that the object is only objectified self-consciousness-self-consciousness as object.  \xa0 \xa0\xa0( Positing of man=self-consciousness.)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The issue, therefore, is to surmount the ,object of consciousness. Objectivity as such is regarded as an estranged human relationship which does not correspond to the essence of man, to self¬consciousness. The re-appropriation of the objective essence of man, begotten in the form of estrangement as something alien, has the meaning therefore not only to annul estrangement, but objectivity as well. Man, that is to say, is regarded as a non-objective, spiritual being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The movement of surmounting the object of consciousness is now described by Hegel in the following way:  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The object reveals itself not merely as returning into the self-for Hegel that is the one-sided way of apprehending this movement, the grasping of only one side. Man is posited as equivalent to self. The self, however, is only the abstractly conceived man-man begotten by abstraction. Man is egotistic. His eye, his ear, etc., are egotistic. In him every one of his essential powers has the quality of selfhood. But it is quite false to say an that account ""Self-consciousness has eyes, ears, essential powers."" Self-consciousness is rather a quality of h uman nature, of the human eye, etc.; it is not human nature that is a quality of self-consciousness.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The self-abstracted and fixed for itself is man as abstract egoist-egoism raised in its pure abstraction to the level of thought. (We shall return to this point later.)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0For Hegel the essence of man-man-equals self-consciousness. All estrangement of the human essence is therefore nothing but estrangement of self-consciousness. The estrangement of self¬consciousness is not regarded as an expression of the real estrangement of the human being-its expression reflected in the realm of knowledge and thought. Instead, the real estrangement-that which appears real-is from its innermost, hidden nature (a nature only brought to light by philosophy) nothing but the manifestation of the estrangement of the real essence of man, of self¬consciousness. The science which comprehends this is therefore called Phenomenology. All re-appropriation of the estranged objective essence appears, therefore, as a process of incorporation into self-consciousness : The man who takes hold of his essential being is merely the self-consciousness which takes hold of objective essences. Return of the object into the self is therefore the re-appropriation of the object.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The surmounting of the object of consciousness, comprehensively expressed, means: 4  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (1) That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing. (2) That it is the alienation of self¬consciousness which establishes thinghood. (3) That this externalization5 of self-consciousness has not merely a negative but a positive significance. (4) That it has this meaning not merely for us or intrinsically, but for self-consciousness itself. (5) For self-consciousness, the negative of the object, its annulling of itself, has positive significance-self-consciousness knows this nullity of the object-because self-consciousness itself alienates itself; for in this alienation it establishes itself as object, or, for the sake of the indivisible unity of being-for-self, establishes the object as itself. (6) On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process, that self-consciousness has also just as much annulled and superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home with itself in its other-being as such (7) This is the movement of consciousness and in this movement consciousness is the totality of its moments. (8) Consciousness must similarly have taken up a relation to the object in all its aspects and phases, and have comprehended it from the point of view of each of them. This totality of its determinate characteristics makes the object intrinsically a spiritual being; and it becomes so in truth for consciousness through the apprehending of each single one of them as self or through what was called above the spiritual attitude to them.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0As to (1): That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing-this is the above-mentioned return of the object into the self.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0As to (2): The alienation of self-consciousness establishes thinghood. Because man equals self-consciousness, his alienated, objective essence, or thinghood, equals alienated self-consciousness, and thinghood is th us established through this alienation (thing hood being that which is an object for man and an object for him is really only that which is to him an essential object, therefore his objective essence. And since it is not real Man, nor therefore Nature-Man being human Nature-who as such is made the subject, but only the abstraction of man-self-consciousness-thinghood cannot be anything but alienated self-conciousness ). It is only to be expected that a living, natural being equipped and endowed with objective (i.e., material) essential powers should have real natural objects of his essence; as is the fact that his self-alienation should lead to the establishing of a real, objective world-but a world in the form of externality-a world, therefore, not belonging to his own essential being, and an over¬powering world. There is nothing incomprehensible or mysterious in this. It would be mysterious, rather, if it were otherwise. But it is equally clear that a self-consciousness can only establish thinghoodthrough its alienation-i.e., establish something which itself is only an abstract thing, a thing of abstraction and not a real thing. It is clear, further, that thinghood is therefore utterly without any independence, any essentiality vis-à-vis self-consciousness; that on the contrary, it is a mere creature-something posited by self-consciousness. And what is posited, instead of confirming itself, is but a confirmation of the act of positing in which is concentrated for a moment the energy of the act as its product, seeming to give the deposit-but only for a moment-the character of an independent, real substance.1  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Whenever real, corporeal man, man with his feet firmly on the solid ground, man exhaling and inhaling all the forces of nature, establishes his real, objective essential powers as alien objects by his externalization, it is not the act of positing which is the subject in this process: it is the subjectivity of objective essential powers whose action, therefore, must also be something obfective.  A being who is objective acts objectively, and he would not act objectively if the objective did not reside in the very nature of his being. He creates or establishes only objects, because he is established by objects-because at bottom he is nature. In the act of establishing, therefore, this objective being does not fall from his state of ""pure activity"" into a creating of the object; on the contrary, his objective product only confirms his objective activity, establishing his activity as the activity of an objective, natural being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Here we see how consistent naturalism or humanism distinguishes itself both from idealism and materialism, constituting at the same time the unifying truth of both. We see also how only naturalism is capable of comprehending the act of world history.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Man is directly a natural being. As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand furnished with natural powers of life-he is an active natural being. These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities-as impulses. On the other hand, as a natural, corporeal, sensuous, objective being he is a suffering, conditioned and limited creature, like animals and plants. That is to say, the objects of his impulses exist outside him, as objects independent of him; yet these objects are objects of his need-essential objects, indispensable to the manifestation and confirmation of his essential powers. To say that man is a corporeal, living, real, sensuous, objective being full of natural vigour is to say that he has real, sensuous, objects as the objects of his being or of his life, or that he can only express his life in real, sensuous objects. To be objective, natural and sensuous, and at the same time to have object, nature and sense outside oneself, or oneself to be object, nature and sense for a third party, is one and the same thing. Hunger is a natural need; it therefore needs a nature outside itself,  an object outside itself, in order to satisfy itself, to be stilled. Hunger is an acknowledged need of my body for an object existing outside it, indispensable to its integration and to the expression of its essential being. The sun is the object of the plant-an indispensable object to it, confirming its life-just as the plant is an object of the sun, being an expression of the life-awakening power of the sun, of the sun\'s objective essential power.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0A being which does not have its nature outside itself is not a natural being, and plays no part in the system of nature. A being which has no object outside itself is not an objective being. A being which is not itself an object for some third being has no being for its object; i.e., it is not objectively related. Its being is not objective. 1  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0An unobjective being is a nullity-an un-being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Suppose a being which is neither an object itself, nor has an object. Such a being, in the first place, would be the unique being: there would exist no being outside it-it would-exist solitary and alone. For as soon as there are objects outside me, as soon as I am not alone, I am another-another reality than the object outside me. For this third object I am thus an other reality than it; that is, I am its object. Thus, to suppose a being which is not the object of another being is to presuppose that no objective being exists. As soon as I have an object, this object has me for an object. But a non-objective being is an unreal, nonsensical thing-something merely thought of (merely imagined, that is)-a creature of abstraction. To be sensuous, that is, to be an object of sense, to be a sensuous object, and thus to have sensuous objects outside one¬self-objects of one\'s sensuousness. To be sensuous is to suffer.8  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Man as an objective, sensuous being is therefore a suffering being-and because he feels what he suffers, a passionate being. Passion is the essential force of man energetically bent on its object.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But man is not merely a natural being: he is a human natural being. That is to say, he is a being for himself. Therefore he is a species being, and has to confirm and manifest himself as such both in his being and in his knowing. Therefore, human objects are not natural objects as they immediately present themselves, and neither is human sense as it immediately is-as it is objectively¬human sensibility, human objectivity. Neither nature objectively nor nature subjectively is directly given in a form adequate to the human being. And as everything natural has to have its beginning, man too has his act of coming-to-be-history-which, however, is for him a known history, and hence as an act of coming-to-be it is a conscious self-transcending act of coming-to-be. History is the true natural history of man (on which more later) .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thirdly, because this establishing of thinghood is itself only sham, an act contradicting the nature of pure activity, it has to be cancelled again and thinghood denied.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Re. 3, 4, 5 and 6. (3) This externalization of consciousness has not merely a negative but a positive significance, and (4) it has this meaning not merely for us or intrinsically, but for consciousness itself.9 (5) For consciousness the negative of the object, its annulling of itself, has positive significance-consciousness knows this nullity of the object because it alienates itself; for in this alienoation it knows itself as object, or, for the sake of the indivisible unity of being-for•itself, the object as itself. (6) On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process, that consciousness has also just as much annulled and superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home with itself in its other-being as such.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0As we have already seen: the appropriation of what is estranged and objective, or the annulling of objectivity in the form of estrangement ( which has to advance from indifferent foreignness to real, antagonistic estrangement) means equally or even primarily for Hegel that it is objectivity which is to be annulled, because it is not the determinate character of the object, but rather its objective character that is offensive and constitutes estrangement for self-consciousness. The object is therefore something negative, self¬annulling nullity. This nullity of the object has not only a negative but a positive meaning for consciousness, for such a nullity of the object is precisely the self•confirmation of the non• objectivity, of the abstraction of itself. For consciousness itself this nullity of the object has a positive meaning because it knows this nullity, the objective being, as its self-alienation; because it knows that it exists only as a result of its own self-alienation....  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The way in which consciousness is, and in which something is for it, is knowing. Knowing is its sale act. Something therefore comes to be for consciousness in so far as the latter knows this something. Knowing is its sale objective relation. Consciousness; then, knows the nullity of the object (i.e., knows the non-existence of the distinction between the object and itself, the non-existence of the object for it) because it knows the object as its self alienation; that is, it knows itself-knows knowing as the object-because the object is only the semblance of an object, a piece of mystification, which in its essence, however, is nothing else but knowing itself, which has confronted itself with itself and in so doing has confronted itself with a nullity-a something which has no objectivity outside the knowing. Or: knowing knows that in relating itself to an object it is only outside itself-that lt only externalizes itself; that it itself appears to itself only as an object-or that that which appears to it as an object is only it itself.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0On the other hand, says Hegel, there is at the same time this other moment in this process, that consciousness has just as much annulled and superseded this externalization and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home in its other-being as such.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In this discussion are brought together all the illusions of speculation.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0First of all: consciousness-self-consciousness-is at home with itself in its other-being as such. It is therefore-or if we here abstract from the Hegelian abstraction and put the self-consciousness of man instead of Self-consciousness-it is at home with itself in its other-being, as such. This implies, for one thing, that consciousness (knowing as knowing, thinking as thinking) pretends to be directly the other of itself-to be the world of sense, the real world, life-thought over-reaching itself in thought (Feuerbach).1 This aspect is contained herein, inasmuch as con¬sciousness as mere consciousness takes offence not at estranged objectivity, but at objectivity as such.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Secondly, this implies that self-conscious man, in so far as he has recognized and annulled and superseded the spiritual world (or his world\'s spiritual, general mode of being) as self-alienation, nevertheless again confirms this in its alienated shape and passes it off as his true mode of being-re-establishes it, and pretends to be at home in his other-being as such. Thus, for instance, after annulling and superseding religion, after recognizing religion to be a product of self-alienation, he yet finds confirmation of himself in religion as religion. Here is the root of Hegel\'s false positivism, or of his merely apparent criticism: this is what Feuerbach designated as the positing, negating and re-establishing of religion or theology-but it has to be grasped in more general terms. Thus reason is at home in unreason as unreason. The man who has recognized that he is leading an alienated life in politics, law, etc., is leading his true human life in this alienated life as such. Self-affirmation, in contradiction with itself-in contradiction both with the knowledge of and with the essential being of the object-is thus true knowledge and life.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0There can therefore no longer be any question about an act of accommodation on Hegel\'s part vis-à-visreligion, the state, etc.,since this lie is the lie of his principle.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If I know religion as alienated human self-consciousness, then what I know in it as religion is not my self-consciousness, but my alienated self-consciousness confirmed in it. I therefore know my own self, the self-consciousness that belongs to its very nature, confirmed not in religion but rather in annihilated and superseded religion.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In Hegel, therefore, the negation of the negation is not the confirmation of the true essence, effected precisely through negation of the pseudo-essence. With him the negation of the negation is the confirmation of the pseudo-essence, or of the self-estranged essence in its denial; or it is the denial of this pseudo-essence as an objective being dwelling outside man and independent of him, and its transformation into the subject.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0A peculiar role, therefore, is played by the act of superseding in which denial and preservation-denial and affirmation-are bound together.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thus, for example, in Hegel\'s Philosophy of Right, Private Right superseded equals Morality, Morality superseded equals the Family, the Family superseded equals Civil Society, Civil Society superseded equals the State, the State superseded equals World History. In the actual world private right, morality, the family, civil society, the state, etc., remain in existence, only they have become moments of man-state of his existence and being-which have no validity in isolation, but dissolve and engender one another, etc. They have become moments of motion.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In their actual existence this mobile nature of theirs is hidden. It first appears and is made manifest in thought, in philosophy. Hence my true religious existence is my existence in the philosophy of religion; my true political existence is my existence within the philosophy of right; my true natural existence, existence in the philosophy of nature; my true artistic existence, existence in the philosophy of art; my true human existence, my existence in philosophy. Likewise the true existence of religion, the state, nature, art is, the philosophy of religion, of nature, of the state and of art. If, however, the philosophy of religion, etc., is for me the sole true existence of religion, then, too, it is only as a philosopher of religion that I am truly religious, and so I deny real religious sentiment and the really religious man. But at the same time I assert them, in part within my own existence or within the alien existence which I oppose to them-for this is only their philosophic expression-and in part I assert them in their own original shape, for they have validity for me as merely the apparent other-being, as allegories, forms of their own true existence ( i.e., of my philosophical existence) hidden under sensuous disguises.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In just the same way, Quality superseded equals Quantity, Quantity superseded equals Measure, Measure superseded equalsEssence, Essence superseded equals Appearance, Appearance superseded equals Actuality, Actuality superseded equals the Concept, the Concept superseded equals Objectivity, Objectivity superseded equals the Absolute Idea, the Absolute Idea superseded equals Nature, Nature superseded equals Ethical Objective Mind, Ethical Mind superseded equals Art, Art superseded equals Religion, Religion superseded equals Absolute Knowledge.2  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0On the one hand, this act of superseding is a transcending of the thought entity; th us, Private Property as a thought is transcended in the thought of morality. And because thought imagines itself to be directly the other of itself, to be sensuous reality-and therefore takes its own action for sensuous, real action-this superseding in thought, which leaves its object standing in the real world, believes that it has really overcome it. On the other hand, because the object has now become for it a moment of thought, thought takes it in its reality too to be self-confirmation of itself-of self• consciousness, of abstraction.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0From the one point of view the existent which Hegel supersedes in philosophy is therefore not real religion, the real state, or real nature, but religion itself already become an object of knowledge, i.c., Dogmatics; thc same with Jurisprudence, Political Science and Natural Science. From the one point of view, therefore, he stands in opposition both to the real thing and to immediate, unphilosophic science or the unphilosophic conceptions of this thing. He therefore contradicts their conventional conceptions.3  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0On the other hand, the religious man, etc., can find in Hegel his final confirmation.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It is now time to lay hold of the positive aspects of the Hegelian dialectic within the realm of estrangement.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (a) Annulling as an objective movement of retracting the alienation into self. This is the insight, expressed within the• estrangement, concerning the appropriation of the objective essence through the annulment of its estrangement; it is the estranged insight into the real objectification of man, into the real appropriation of his objective essence through the annihilation of the estranged character of the objective world, through the annulment of the objective world in its estranged mode of being-just as atheism, being the annulment of God, is the advent of theoretic humanism, and communism, as the annulment of private property, is the justification of real human life as man\'s possession and thus the advent of practical humanism (or just as atheism is humanism mediated with itself through the annulment of religion, whilst communism is humanism mediated with itself through the annulment of private property). Only through the annulment of this mediation-which is itself, however, a necessary premise-does positively self-deriving humanism, positive humanism, come into being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But atheism and communism are no flight, no abstraction; they are not a losing of the objective world begotten by man-of man\'s essential powers given over to the realm of objectivity; they are not a returning in poverty to unnatural, primitive simplicity. On the contrary, they are but the first real coming-to-be, the realization become real for man, of man\'s essence-of the essence of man as something real.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thus, by grasping the positive meaning of self-referred negation (if even again in estranged fashion) Hegel grasps man\'s self¬estrangement, the alienation of man\'s essence, man\'s loss of objectivity and his loss of realness as finding of self, change of his nature, his objectification and realization. In short, within the sphere of abstraction, Hegel conceives labour as man\'s act of self¬genesis-conceives man\'s relation to himself as an alien being and the manifesting of h imself as an alien being to be the coming-to-be of species-consciousness and species-life.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 (b) However, apart from, or rather in consequence of, the perverseness already described, this act appears in Hegel:  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0First of all as a merely formal, because abstract, act, because the human essence itself is taken to be only an abstract, thinking essence, conceived merely as. self-consciousness. And, \xa0 \xa0 \xa0secondly, because the conception is formal and abstract, the annulment of the alienation becomes a confirmation of the alienation; or again, for Hegel this movement of self-genesis and self¬objectification in the form of self-alienation and self-estrangement is the absolute, and hence final, expression of human life-of life with itself as its aim, of life at rest in itself, of life that has attained oneness with its essence.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0This movement, in its abstract form as dialectic, is therefore regarded as truly human life, and because it is nevertheless an abstraction-an estrangement of human life-it is regarded as a divine process, but as the divine process of man, a process traversed by man\'s abstract, pure, absolute essence that is distinct from him.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thirdly, this process must have a bearer, a subject. But the subject first emerges as a result. This result-the subject knowing itself as absolute self-consciousness-is therefore God-absolute Spirit-the self-knowing and self-manifesting Idea. Real man and real nature become mere predicates-symbols of this esoteric, unreal man and of this unreal nature. Subject and predicate are therefore related to each other in absolute inversion-a mystical subject¬object or a subjectivity reaching beyond the object-the absolute subject as a process, as subject alienating itself and returning from alienation into itself, but at the same time retracting this alienationinto itself, and the subject as this process; a pure, restless revolving within itself.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0First, the formal and abstract conception of man\'s act of self¬genesis or self-objectification.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Hegel having posited man as equivalent to self-consciousness, the estranged object-the estranged essential reality of man-is nothing but consciousness, the thought of estrangement merely¬estrangement\'s abstract and therefore empty and unreal expression, negation. The annulment of the alienation is therefore likewise nothing but an abstract, empty annulment of that empty abstraction-the negation of the negation. The rich, living, sensuous, concrete activity of self-objectification is therefore reduced to its mere abstraction, absolute negativity-an abstraction which is again fixed as such and thought of as an independent activity-as sheer activity. Because this so-called negativity is nothing but the abstract, empty form of that real living act, its content can in consequence be merely a formal content begotten by abstraction from all content. As a result there are general, abstract forms of abstraction pertaining to every content and on that account indifferent to, and, consequently, valid for, all content-the thought-forms or logical categories torn from real mind and from real nature. (We shall unfold the logical content of absolute negativity further on.)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Hegel\'s positive achievement here, in his speculative logic, is that the determinate concepts, the universal fixed thought-forms in their independence vis-à-vis nature and mind are a necessary result of the general estrangement of the human essence and therefore also of human thought, and that Hegel has there-fore brought these together and presented them as moments of the abstraction¬process. For example, superseded Being is Essence, superseded Essence is Concept, the Concept superseded is ... the Absolute Idea. But what, then, is the Absolute Idea? It supersedes its own self again, if it does not want to traverse once more from the beginning the whole act of abstraction, and to acquiesce in being a totality of abstractions or in being the self-comprehending abstraction. But abstraction comprehending itself as abstraction knows itself to be nothing: it must abandon itself-abandon abstraction-and so it arrives at an entity which is its exact contrary -at nature. Thus, the entire Logic is the demonstration that abstract thought is nothing in itself; that the Absolute Idea is nothing in itself; that only Nature is something.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The absolute idea, the abstract idea, which ""considered with regard to its unity with itself is intuiting,""4 ( Hegel\'s Encyclopaedia, 3rd edition, p. 222 ) , and which ""in its own absolute truth resolves to let the moment of its particularity or of initial characterization and other-being-the immediate idea, as its reflection, go forth freely from itself as nature"" (l.c.)-this whole idea which behaves in such a strange and singular way, and which has given the Hegelians such terrible headaches, is from beginning to end nothing else but abstraction ( i.e., the abstract thinker)¬abstraction which, made wise by experience and enlightened concerning its truth, resolves under various (false and themselves still abstract) conditions to abandon itself and to replace its self¬absorption, nothingness, generality and indeterminateness by its other-being, the particular, and the determinate; resolves to let nature, which it held hidden in itself only as an abstraction, as a thought-entity, go forth freely from itself: that is to say, abstraction resolves to forsake abstraction and to have a look at nature free of abstraction. The abstract idea, which without mediation becomes intuiting, is nothing else through-and-through but abstract thinking that gives itself up and resolves on intuition. This entire transition from Logic to Natural Philosophy is nothing else but the transition-so difficult to effect for the abstract thinker and therefore so queer in his description of it-from abstracting to intuiting. The mystical feeling which drives the philosopher forward from abstract thinking to intuiting is boredom-the longing for a content. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ( The man estranged from himself is also the thinker estranged from his essence-that is, from the natural and human essence. His thoughts are therefore fixed mental shapes or ghosts dwelling outside nature and man. Hegel has locked up all these fixed mental forms together in his Logic, laying hold of each of them first as negation-that is, as an alienation of human thought-and then as negation of the negation-that is, as a superseding of this alienation, as a real expression of human thought. But as even this still takes place within the confines of the estrangement, this negation of the negation is in part the restoring of these fixed forms in their estrangement; in part a stopping-short at the last act-the act of self-reference in alienation-as the true mode of being of these fixed mental forms;5 and in part, to the extent that this abstraction apprehends itself and experiences an infinite weariness with itself, there makes its appearance in Hegel, in the formof the resolution to recognize nature as the essential being and to go over to intuition, the abandonment of abstract thought-the abandonment of thought revolving solely within the orbit of thought, of thought devoid of eyes, of teeth, of ears, of everything.)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But nature too, taken abstractly, for itself-nature fixed in isolation from man-is nothing for man. It goes without saying that the abstract thinker who has committed himself to intuiting, intuits nature abstractly. Just as nature lay enclosed in the thinker in the form of the absolute idea, in the form of a thought-entity-in a shape which is his and yet is esoteric and mysterious even to him-so what he has let go forth from himself in truth is only this abstract nature, only nature as a thought-entity-but with the significance now of being the other-being of thought, of being real, intuited nature-of being nature distinguished from abstract thought. Or, to talk a human language, the abstract thinker learns in his intuition of nature that the entities which he thought to create from nothing, from pure abstraction-the entities he believed he was producing in the divine dialectic as pure products of the labour of thought forever weaving in itself and never looking outward-are nothing else but abstractions from characteristics of nature. To him, therefore, the whole of nature merely repeats the logical abstractions in a sensuous, external form . He analyses it and these abstractions over again. Thus, his intuition of nature is only the act of confirming his abstraction from the intuition of nature-is only the conscious repetition by him of the process of begetting his abstraction. Thus, for example, Time equals Negativity referred to itself (l.c., p. 238): to the superseded Becoming as Being there corresponds, in natural form, superseded Movement as Matter. Light is Reflection-in-Itself, in natural form. Body as Moon and Comet is the natural form of the antithesis which according to the Logic is on the one side the Positive resting on itself and on the other side the Negative resting on itself. The Earth is the natural form of the logical Ground, as the negative unity of the anti thesis, etc.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Nature as nature-that is to say, in so far as it is still sensuously distinguished from that secret sense hidden within it-nature isolated, distinguished from these abstractions, is nothing-a nothing proving itself to be nothing-is devoid of sense, or has only the sense of being an externality which has to be annulled.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 &nb\xa0 \xa0""In the finite-teleological position is to be found the correct \xa0 \xa0 \xa0premise that nature does not contain within itself the absolute purpose"" (p. 225 ) \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Its purpose is the confirmation of abstraction. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ""Nature has shown itself to be the Idea in the form of \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 other-being. Since the Idea is in this form the negative of itself \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 or external to itself, nature is not just relatively external vis-à-vis \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 this idea, but externality constitutes the form in which it exists as nature"" (p. 227 ) .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Externality here is not to be understood as the self-externalizing world of sense open to the light, open to the man endowed with senses. It is to be taken here in the sense of alienation-a mistake, a defect, which ought not to be. For what is true is still the Idea. Nature is only the form of the Idea\'s other-being. And since abstract thought is the essence, that which is external to it is by its essence something merely external. The abstract thinker recognizes at the same time that sensuousness-externality in contrast to thought weaving within itself-is the essence of nature. But he expresses his contrast in such a way as to make this externality of nature, its contrast to thought, its defect, so that inasmuch as it is distinguished from abstraction, nature is something defective. Something which is defective not merely for me or in my eyes but in itself-intrinsically-has something outside itself which it lacks. That is, its being is something other than it itself. Nature has therefore to supersede itself for the abstract thinker, for it is already posited by him as a potentially superseded being.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ""For us, Mind has nature, for its premise, being nature\'s truth \xa0 \xa0\xa0 and for that reason its absolute prius. In this truth nature has vanished, and mind has resulted as the Idea arrived at being- \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 for-itself, the object of which, as well as the subject, is the con- \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 cept. This identity is absolute negativity, for whereas in nature \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 the concept has its perfect external objectivity, this its alienation \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 has been superseded, and in this alienation the concept has \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 become identical with itself. But it is this identity, therefore, \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 in being a return out of nature"" (p. 392 ). \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ""As the abstract idea, revelation is unmediated transition to, \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 the coming-to-be of, nature; as the revelation of the mind, which \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 is free, it is the establishing of nature as the mind\'s world-an \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 establishing which at the same time, being reflection, is a presup- \xa0\xa0\xa0 posing of the world as independently-existing nature.

The ""Prussian"" who wrote the article Marx attacks was Arnold Ruge. The event under discussion was the Silesian weavers\' uprising of June 1844. The essay was written in July 1844 and published the following month in the newspaper Vorwarts.  \xa0\xa0\xa0No. 60 of Vorwarts contains an article headed ""Der Konig von Preussen und die Sozialreform,"" signed ""A Prussian."" \xa0\xa0\xa0First of all this alleged Prussian sets out the content of the royal Prussian Cabinet order on the uprising of the Silesian workers and the opinion of the French newspaper La Reforme on the Prussian Cabinet order. The Reforme, he writes, considers that the King\'s ""alarm and religious feeling"" are the source of the Cabinet order. It even sees in this document a presentiment of the great reforms which are in prospect for bourgeois society. The ""Prussian"" lectures the Réforme as follows :  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The King and German society has not yet arrived at the ‘pre-sentiment of \xa0 \xa0 \xa0their reform,"" even the Silesian and Bohemian uprisings have not aroused \xa0 \xa0 \xa0this feeling. It is impossible to makesuch an unpolitical \xa0 \xa0 \xa0country as Gemany regard the partial distressof the factory districts \xa0 \xa0 \xa0as a matter of general concern, let alone as an affliction of the whole civilised \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 world. The Germans regard this event as if it were of the same nature as \xa0 \xa0 \xa0any local distress due to flood or famine. Hence the King regards it as due \xa0 \xa0 \xa0to deficiencies in the administration or in charitable activity. For this \xa0 \xa0 \xa0reason, and because a few soldiers sufficed to cope with the feeble weavers, \xa0 \xa0 \xa0the destruction of factories and machinery, too, did not inspire any ""alarm"" \xa0 \xa0 \xa0either in the King or the authorities.Indeed, the Cabinet order was not \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 prompted even by religious feeling: it is a very sober \xa0 \xa0 \xa0expression of the Christian art of statesmanship and of a doctrine which \xa0 \xa0 \xa0considers that no difficulties can withstand its sole medicine-""the well \xa0 \xa0 \xa0-disposed Christian  hearts."" Poverty and crime are two great evils; who can \xa0 \xa0 \xa0cure them? The state and the authorities? No, but the union of all Christian \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0hearts can.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The alleged Prussian denies the King\'s ""alarm"" on the grounds, among others, that a few soldiers sufficed to cope with the feeble weavers.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Therefore, in a country where ceremonial dinners with liberal toasts and liberally foaming champagne-recall the Dusseldorf festival inspired a royal Cabinet order;1where not a single soldier was needed to shatter the desires of the entire liberal bourgeoisie for freedom of the press and a constitution; in a country where passive obedience is the order of the day-<:an it be that in such a country the necessity to employ armed force against feeble weavers is not an event, and not an alarming event? Moreover, at the first encounter the feeble weavers were victorious. They were suppressed only by subsequent troop reinforcements. Is the uprising of a body of workers less dangerous because it did not require a whole army to suppress it? Let the wise Prussian compare the uprising of the Silesian weavers with the revolts of the English workers, and the Silesian weavers will be seen by him to be strong weavers.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Starting out from the general relation of politics to social ills, we shall show why the uprising of the weavers could not cause the King any special ""alarm."" For the time being we shall say only the following: the uprising was not aimed directly against the King of Prussia, but against the bourgeoisie. As an aristocrat and absolute monarch, the King of Prussia cannot love the bourgeoisie; still less can he be alarmed if the submissiveness and impotence of the bourgeoisie is increased because of a tense and difficult relationship between it and the proletariat. Further: the orthodox Catholic is more hostile to the orthodox Protestant than to the atheist, just as the Legitimist is more hostile to the liberal than to the Communist. This is not because the atheist and the Communist are more akin to the Catholic or Legitimist, but because they are more foreign to him than are the Protestant and the liberal, being outside his circle. In the sphere of politics, the King of Prussia, as a politician, has his direct opposite in liberalism. For the King, the proletariat is as little an antithesis as the King is for the proletariat. The proletariat would have to have already attained considerable power for it to stifle the other antipathies and political antitheses and to divert to itself all political enmity. Finally: in view of the well-known charac¬ter of the King, avid for anything interesting and significant, it must have been a joyful surprise for him to discover this ""interesting"" and ""much discussed"" pauperism in his own territory and con-sequently a new opportunity for making people talk about him. How pleasant for him must have been the news that henceforth he posseses his ""own,"" royal Prussian pauperism! Let us suppose * * * that the ""Prussian\'s"" remarks about the German Government and the German bourgeoisie-after all, the latter is included in "" German society""-are entirely well founded. Is this section of society more at a loss in Germany than in England and France? Can one be more at a loss than, for example, in England, where perplexity has been made into a system? When today workers\' revolts break out throughout England, the bourgeoisie and government there know no better what to do than in the last third of the eighteenth century. Their sole expedient is material force, and since this material force diminishes in the same proportion as the spread of pauperism and the understanding of the proletariat increase, England\'s perplexity inevitably grows in geometrical progression. \xa0\xa0\xa0Finally, it is untrue, actually untrue, that the German bourgeoisie totally fails to understand the general significance of the Silesian uprising. In several towns the masters are trying to act jointly with the apprentices. All the liberal German newspapers, the organs of the liberal bourgeoisie, teem with articles about the organisation of labour, the reform of society, criticism of monopolies and competition, etc. All this is the result of the movements among the workers.* * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0* * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0Let us pass now to the oracular pronouncements of the ""Prussian"" on the German workers. ""The German poor,"" he says wittily, ""are no wiser than the poor Germans, i.e., nowhere do they see beyond their own hearth and home, their own factory, their own district; the whole question has so far still been ignored by the all-penetrating political soul.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0In order to be able to compare the condition of the German workers with the condition of the French and English workers, the ""Prussian"" would have had to compare the first form, the start, of the English and French workers\' movement with the Germanmovement that is just beginning. He failed to do so. Consequently, his arguments lead to trivialities, such as that industry in Germany is not yet so developed as in England, or that a movement at its start looks different from the movement in its subsequent progress. He wanted to speak about the specific character of the German workers\' movement, but he has not a word to say on this subject of his.  \xa0\xa0\xa0On the other hand, suppose the ""Prussian"" were to adopt the correct standpoint. He will find that not one of the French and English workers\' uprisings had such a theoretical and consciouscharacter as the uprising of the Silesian weavers.  \xa0\xa0\xa0First of all, recall the song of the weavers,2 that bold call to struggle, in which there is not even a mention of hearth and home, factory or district, but in which the proletariat at once, in a striking, sharp, unrestrained and powerful manner, proclaims its opposition to the society of private property. The Silesian uprising begins precisely with what the French and English workers\' uprisings end, with consciousness of the nature of the proletariat. The action itself bears the stamp of this superior character. Not only machines, these rivals of the workers, are destroyed, but also ledgers, the titles to property. And while all other movements were aimed primarily only against the owner of the industrial enterprise, the visible enemy, this movement is at the same time directed against the banker, the hidden enemy. Finally, not a single English workers\' uprising was carried out with such courage, thought and endurance.  \xa0\xa0\xa0As for the educational level or capacity for education of the German workers in general, I call to mind Weitling\'s brilliant writings, which as regards theory are often superior even to those of Proudhon, however much they are inferior to the latter in their exe¬cution. Where among the bourgeoisie including its philosophers and learned writers is to be found a book about the emancipation of the bourgeoisie-political emancipation similar to Weitling\'s work: Garantien der Harmonie und Freiheit? It is enough to compare the petty, faint-hearted mediocrity of German political literature with this vehement and briliant literary debut of the German workers, it is enough to compare these gigantic infant shoes of the proletariat with the dwarfish, worn-out political shoes of the German bourgeoisie, and one is bound to prophesy that the German Cinderella will one day have the figure of an athlete. It has to be admitted that the German proletariat is the theoretician of the European proletariat, just as the English proletariat is its econo¬mist, and the French proletariat its politician. It has to be admitted that Germany is just as much classically destined for a social revolution as it is incapable of a political one. For, just as the impotence of the German bourgeoisie is the political impotence of Germany cial capability of Germany. The disparity between the philosophical and the political development of Germany is not an anomaly. It is an inevitable disparity. A philosophical people can find its corresponding practice only in socialism, hence it is only in the proletariat that it can find the dynamic elements of its emancipation.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0* *  *  \xa0\xa0\xa0Why does the ""Prussian"" judge the German workers so contemptuously? Because he finds that the ""whole question""-namely, the question of the distressed state of the workers-has ""so far still"" been ignored by the ""all-penetrating politicalsoul"" He expounds his platonic love for the political soul in more detail as follows : ""Alluprisings which break out in this disastrous isolation of people from the community, and of their thoughts from social principles, will be smothered in blood and incomprehension; but when distress pro¬duces understanding, and the political understanding of the Germans discovers the roots of social distress, then in Germany too these events will be appreciated as symptoms of a great revolution.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0* *  *  \xa0\xa0\xa0Thatsocial distress produces political understanding is so incorrect . that, on the contrary, what is correct is the opposite : social well-being produces political understanding. Political understanding is a spiritualist, and is given to him who already has, to him who is already comfortably situated. Let our ""Prussian"" listen to a French economist, M. Michel Chevalier, on this subject: ""\'When the bourgeoisie rose up in 1789, it lacked in order to be free only participation in governing the country. Emancipation consisted for it in wresting the control of public affairs, the principal civil, military and religious functions, from the hands of the privileged who had the monopoly of these functions. Rich and enlightened, capable of being self-sufficient and of managing its own affairs, it wanted to escape from the system of arbitrary rule.""3  \xa0\xa0\xa0We have already shown the ""Prussian"" how incapable politicalunderstanding is of discovering the source of social distress. Just oneword more on this view of his. The more developed and universal the political understanding of a people, the more does the proletariat-at any rate at the beginning of the movement-squander its forces in senseless, useless revolts, which are drowned in blood. Because it thinks in the framework of politics, the proletariat sees the cause of all evils in the will, and all means of remedy in violence and in the overthrow of a particular form of state. The proof: the first uprisings of the French proletariat.4 The Lyons workers believed that they were pursuing only political aims, that they were only soldiers of the republic, whereas actually they were soldiers of socialism. Thus their political understanding concealed from them the roots of social distress, thus it falsified their insight into their real aim, thus their political understanding deceived their social instinct.  \xa0\xa0\xa0But if the ""Prussian"" expects understanding to be produced by distress, why does he lump together ""smothering in blood"" and ""smothering in incomprehension""? If distress is in general a means of producing understanding, then bloody distress is even a very acute means to this end. The ""Prussian"" therefore should have said: smothering in blood will smother incomprehension and procure a proper current of air for the understanding.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 The ""Prussian"" prophesies the smothering of uprisings which break out in ""disastrous isolation of people from the community, and in the separation of their thoughts from social principles.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0We have shown that the Silesian uprising occurred by no means in circumstances of the separation of thoughts from social principles. It only remains for us to deal with the ""disastrous isolation of people from the community."" By community here is meant the political community, the state. This is the old story about unpolitical Germany.  \xa0\xa0\xa0But do not all uprisings, without exception, break out in a disas-trous isolation of man from the community? Does not every uprising necessarily presuppose isolation? Would the 1789 revolution have taken place without the disastrous isolation of French citizens from the community? It was intended precisely to abolish this isolation.  \xa0\xa0\xa0But the community from which the worker is isolated is a community the real character and scope of which is quite different from that of the political community . The community from which the worker is isolated by his own labour is life itself, physical and mental life, human morality, human activity, human enjoyment, human nature. Human nature is the true community of men. The disastrous isolation from this essential nature is incomparably more universal, more intolerable, more dreadful, and more contradictory, than isolation from the political community. Hence, too, the abolition of this isolation and even a partial reaction to it, an uprisingagainst it-is just as much more infinite as man is more infinite than the citizen, and human life more infinite than political life. Therefore, however partial the uprising of the industrial workersmay be, it contains within itself a universal soul; however universal a political uprising may be, it conceals even in its most grandioseform a narrow-minded spirit.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The ""Prussian"" worthily concludes his article with the following sentence: ""A social revolution without a political soul (i.e., without an organising idea from the point of view of the whole ) is im¬possible.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0We have already seen that a social revolution is found to have the point of view of the whole because even if it were to occur in only one factory district it represents man\'s protest against a de- humanised life, because it starts out from the point of view of a separate real individual, because the community, against the separation of which from himself the individual reacts, is man\'s true community, human nature. The politicalsoul of revolution, on the other hand, consists in the tendency of classes having no political influence to abolish their isolation from statehood and rule. Its point of view is that of the state, of an abstractwhole, which exists only through separation from real life, and which is inconceivablewithout the organized contradiction between the universal idea of man and the individual existence of man. Hence, too, a revolution with a political soul, in accordance with the limited and dichotomous nature of this soul, organises a ruling stratum in society at the expense of society itself.  \xa0\xa0\xa0We want to divulge to the ""Prussian"" what a ""social revolutionwith a political soul"" actually is; we shall thereby at the same time confide the secret to him that he himself is unable, even in words, to rise above the narrow-minded political point of view.  \xa0\xa0\xa0A ""social"" revolution with a political soul is either a nonsensical concoction, if by ""social"" revolution the ""Prussian"" means a ""social"" as opposed to a political revolution, and nevertheless endows the social revolution with a political soul instead of a social one; or else a ""social revolution with a political soul"" is only a paraphrase for what was usually called a ""political revolution,"" or ""simply a revolution."" Every revolution dissolves the old society!\' and to that extent it is social. Every revolution overthrows the old powerand to that extent it is political.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Let the ""Prussian"" choose between theparaphrase and the nonsense! But whereas a social revolution with a political soul is a para-phrase or nonsense, a political revolution with a social soul has a rational meaning. Revolution in general-the overthrow of the existing power and dissolution of the old relationships is a politi¬cal act. But socialism cannot be realised without revolution. It needs this political act insofar as it needs destruction and dissolution. But where its organizing activity!\' begins, where its proper object, its soul, comes to the fore-there socialism throws off the political cloak.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0* *  *  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Alienation and Social Classes  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0KARL MARX  A meeting between Marx and Engels in Paris at the end of August, 1844, inaugurated their lifelong collaboration. Their first jointly written work, published in 1845, was The Holy Family: A Critique of Critical Criticism, a heavily satirical polemic against Bruno Bauer and the Young Hegelians. The following passage, probably written by Marx, shows the alienation doctrine of the 1844 manuscripts merging into the class struggle doctrine as we encounter it in The German Ideology and later Marxist writings. It is also of value as a revelation of Marx\'s special way of conceiving and ex¬plaining historical necessity.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The translation for this edition is by R. C. Tucker  \xa0\xa0\xa0* * *The proletariat and wealth are opposites. As such they form a whole. They are both products of the world of private property. The whole question is what position each of these two ele¬ments occupies within the opposition. It does not suffice to pro-claim them two sides of one whole.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Private property as private property, as wealth, is compelled to preserve its own existence and thereby the existence of its opposite, the proletariat. This is the positive side of the antagonism, private property satisfied with itself.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The proletariat, on the other hand, is compelled to abolish itself and thereby its conditioning opposite private property which makes it a proletariat. This is the negative side of the antagonism, its disturbance within itself, private property abolished and in the process of abolishing itself.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The possessing class and the proletarian class represent one and the same human self-alienation.2 But the former feels satisfied and affirmed in this self-alienation, experiences the alienation as a sign of its own power, and possesses in it the appearance of a human existence. The latter, however, feels destroyed in this alienation, seeing in it its own impotence and the reality of an inhuman existence. To use Hegel\'s expression, this class is, within depravity, anIndignation against this depravity, an indignation necessarily aroused in this class by the contradiction between its human natureand its life-situation, which is a blatant, outright and all-embracing denial of that very nature.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Within the antagonism as a whole, therefore, private property represents the conservative side and the proletariat the destructiveside. From the former comes action aimed at preserving the antago¬nism; from the latter, action aimed at its destruction.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In its economic movement, it is true, private property presses towards its own dissolution, but it does this only by means of a developmental course that is unconscious and takes place independently of it and against its will, a course determined by the nature of the thing itself. It does this only by giving rise to the proletariat as proletariat this poverty conscious of its own spiritual and physical poverty, this dehumanization which is conscious of itself as a dehumanization and hence abolishes itself.3 The proletariat executes the sentence that proletariat producing private property passes upon itself, just as it executes the sentence that wage labour passes upon itself by producing others\' wealth and its own poverty. When the proletariat wins victory, it by no means becomes the absolute side of society, for it wins victory only by abolishing itself and its opposite. Both the proletariat itself and its conditioning opposite-private property disappear with the victory of the proletariat.  \xa0\xa0\xa0If socialist writers attribute this world historical role to the proletariat, this is by no means, as critical criticism assures us, because they regard the proletarians as gods. On the contrary. Since the fully formed proletariat represents, practically speaking, the completed abstraction from everything human, even from the appearance of being human; since all the living conditions of contemporary society have reached the acme of inhumanity in the living conditions of the proletariat; since in the proletariat man has lost himself, although at the same time he has both acquired a theoretical consciousness of this loss and has been directly forced into indigna¬tion against this inhumanity by virtue of an inexorable, utterly unembellishable, absolutely imperious need, that practical expression of necessity-because of all this the proletariat itself can and must liberate itself. But it cannot liberate itself without destroying its own living conditions. It cannot do so without destroying all the inhuman living conditions of contemporary society which are concentrated in its own situation. Not in vain does it go through the harsh but hardening school of labour. It is not a matter of what this or that proletarian or even the proletariat as a whole pictures at present as its goal . It is a matter of what the proletariat is in actuality and what, in accordance with this being, it will historically becompelled t o d o . Its goal and its historical action are prefigured in the most clear and ineluctable way in its own life-situation as well as in the whole organization of contemporary bourgeois society. There is no need to harp on the fact that a large part of the English and French proletariat is already conscious of its historic task and is continually working to bring this consciousness to full clar¬ity.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  Society and Economy in History  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0   KARL MARX  This selection comes from Marx\'s letter of December 28, 1846, to P. V. Annenkov, who had asked for his opinion of Pierre• Joseph Proudhon\'s new book The Philosophy of Poverty. Marx subsequently expanded his critique of the book into a book-length polemic, The Poverty of Philosophy( themeat of which is succinctly stated in this letter).  \xa0\xa0\xa0 The material here presented is of interest as a trenchant statement of the materialist conception of history, Marx\'s enlarged understanding of the division of labor as a ubiquitous fact of human historical development, his view on the evolution of machinery, and his notion of dialectics as a process that finds final resolution in a social condition beyond conflict (""contradictions"") . Since this document appeared at the close of Marx\'s early period, it conclusively disproves the notion of a hiatus between a Hegelian-Feuer- bachian philosophical early Marx who hadn\'t reached historical materialism, and a scientific mature Marx who had.*  It was in and through the early writings represented in this section of our reader that Marx created historical materialism.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  * * *M. Proudhon sees in history a series of social developments; he finds progress realised in history; finally he finds that men, as individuals, did not know what they were doing and were mistaken about their own movement, that is to say, their social development seems at the first glance to be distinct, separate and independent of their individual development. He cannot explain these facts, and so the hypothesis of universal reason manifesting itself comes in very handy. Nothing is easier than to invent mystical causes, that is to say, phrases which lack common sense.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But when M. Proudhon admits that he understands nothing about the historical development of humanity-he admits this by using such high-sounding words as : Universal Reason, God, etc.¬is he not implicitly and necessarily admitting that he is incapable of understanding economic development?  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0What is society, whatever its form may be? The product of men\'s reciprocal action. Are men free to choose this or that form of society? By no means. Assume a particular state of development in the productive faculties of man and you will get a particular form of commerce and consumption. Assume particular stages of development in production, commerce and consumption and you will have a corresponding social constitution, a corresponding organisation of the family, of orders or of classes, in a word, a corresponding civil society. Assume a particular civil society and you will get particular political conditions which are only the official expression of civil society. M. Proudhon will never understand this because he thinks he is doing something great by appealing from the state to civil society that is to say, from the official resume of society to official society.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is superfluous to add that men are not free to choose their productive forces-which are the basis of all their history for every productive force is an acquired force, the product of former activity. The productive forces are therefore the result of practical human energy; but this energy is itself conditioned by the circumstances in which men find themselves, by the productive forces already acquired, by the social form which exists before they do, which they do not create, which is the product of the preceding generation. Because of this simple fact that every succeeding generation finds itself in possession of the productive forces acquired by the previous generation, which serve it as the raw material for new production, a coherence arises in human history, a history of humanity takes shape which is all the more a history of humanity as the productive forces of man and therefore his social relations have been more developed. Hence it necessarily follows that the social history of men is never anything but the history of their individual development, whether they are conscious of it or not. Their material relations are the basis of all their relations. These material relations are only the necessary forms in which their material and individual activity is realised.  \xa0\xa0\xa0M. Proudhon mixes up ideas and things. Men never relinquish what they have won, but this does not mean that they never relinquish the social form in which they have acquired certain productive forces. On the contrary, in order that they may not be deprived of the result attained and forfeit the fruits of civilisation, they are obliged, from the moment when their mode of carrying on commerce no longer corresponds to the productive forces acquired, to change all their traditional social forms. I am using the word ""commerce"" here in its widest sense, as we use Verkehr in German. For example: the privileges, the institution of guilds and corporations, the regulatory regime of the Middle Ages, were social relations that alone corresponded to the acquired productive forces and to the social condition which had previously existed and from which these institutions had arisen. Under the protection of the regime of cor-porations and regulations, capital was accumulated, overseas trade was developed, colonies were founded. But the fruits of this menwould have forfeited if they had tried to retain the forms under whose shelter these fruits had ripened. Hence burst two thunder¬claps-the Revolutions of 1640 and 1688. All the old economic forms, the social relations corresponding to them, the political conditions which were the official expression of the old civil society, were destroyed in England. Thus the economic forms in which men produce, consume, and exchange, are transitory and historical. With the acquisition of new productive faculties, men change their mode of production and with the mode of production all the economic relations which are merely the necessary relations of this particular mode of production.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This is what M. Proudhon has not understood and still less demonstrated. M. Proudhon, incapable of following the real movement of history, produces a phantasmagoria which presumptuously claims to be dialectical. He does not feel it necessary to speak of .the seven teenth, the eighteenth or the nineteenth century, for his history proceeds in the misty realm of imagination and rises far above space and time. In short, it is not history but old Hegelian junk, it is not profane history-a history of man-but sacred history-a history of ideas. From his point of view man is only the instrument of which the idea or the eternal reason makes use in order to unfold itself. The evolutions of which M. Proudhon speaks are understood to be evolutions such as are accomplished within the mystic womb of the absolute idea. If you tear the veil from thisaP1ystical language, what it comes to is that M. Proudhon is offering you the order in which economic categories arrange themselves inside his own mind. It wi1l not require great exertion on my part to prove to you that it is the order of a very disorderly mind.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The series of economic evolutions of the eternal reason begins with divisionof labour. To M. Proudhon division of labour is a perfectly simple thing. But was not the caste regime also a particular division of labour? Was not the regime of the corporations another division of labour? And is not the division of labour under the system of manufacture, which in England begins in the middle of the seventeenth century and comes to an end in the last part of the eighteenth, also totally different from the division of labour in large-scale, modern industry?  \xa0\xa0\xa0M. Proudhon is so far from the truth that he neglects what even the profane economists attend to. When he talks about division of labour he does not feel it necessary to mention the world market. Good. Yet must not the division of labour in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, when there were still no colonies, when America did not as yet exist for Europe, and Eastern Asia only existed for her through the medium of Constantinople, have been fundamentally different from what it was in the seventeenth century when colonies were already developed.  \xa0\xa0\xa0And that is not all. Is the whole inner organisation of nations, areall their international relations anything else than the expression of a particular division of labour? And must not these change when the division of labour changes?  \xa0\xa0\xa0M. Proudhon has so little understood the problem of the division of labour that he never even mentions the separation of town and country, which took place in Germany, for instance, from the ninth to the twelfth century. Thus, to M. Proudhon, this separation is an eternal law since he knows neither its origin nor its development. All through his book he speaks as if this creation of a particular mode of production would endure until the end of time. All that M. Proudhon says about the division of labour is only a summary, and moreover a very superficial and incomplete summary, ofwhat Adam Smith and a thousand others have said before him .  \xa0\xa0\xa0The second evolution is machinery. The connection between the division of labour and machinery is entirely mystical to M. Proud¬hon. Each kind of division of labour had its specific instruments of production. Between the middle of the seventeenth and themiddle of the eighteenth century, for instance, people did not make everything by hand. They had instruments, and very complicated ones at that, such as looms, ships, levers, etc.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Thus there is nothing more absurd than to derive machinery from division of labour in general.  \xa0\xa0\xa0I may also remark, by the way, that M. Proudhon has understood very little the historical origin of machinery, but has still less understood its development. One can say that up to the year 1825-the period of the first general crisis-the demands of consumption in general increased more rapidly than production, and the development of machinery was a necessary consequence of the needs of the market. Since 1825, the invention and application of machinery has been simply the result of the war between workers and employers. But this is only true of England. As for the European nations, they were driven to adopt machinery owing to English competition both in their home markets and on the world market. Finally, in North America the introduction of machinery was due both to competition with other countries and to lack of hands, that is, to the disproportion between the population of North America and its industrial needs. From these facts you can see what sagacity Monsieur Proudhon develops when he conjures up the spectre of competition as the third evolution, the antithesis to machinery!  \xa0\xa0\xa0Lastly and in general, it is altogether absurd to make machineryan economic category alongside with division of labour, competition, credit, etc.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Machinery is no more an economic category than the ox which draws the plough. The application of machinery in the present day is one of the relations of our present economic system, but the wayin which machinery is utilised is totally distinct from the machinery itself. Powder is powder whether used to wound a man or to dress his wounds.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0M. Proudhon, mainly because he lacks the historical knowledge, has not perceived that as men develop their productive faculties, that is, as they live, they develop certain relations with one another and that the nature of these relations must necessarily change with the change and growth of the productive faculties. He has not perceived that economic categories are only abstract expressions of these actual relations and only remain true while these relations exist. He therefore falls into the error of the bourgeois economists, who regard these economic categories as eternal and not as historical laws which are only laws for a particular historical development, for a definite development of the productive forces. Instead, therefore, of regarding the political-economic categories as abstract expressions of the real, transitory, historic social relations, Monsieur Proudhon, thanks to a mystic inversion, sees in the real relations only embodiments of these abstractions. These abstractions themselves are formulas which have been slumbering in the heart of God the Father since the beginning of the world.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0Monsieur Proudhon has very well grasped the fact that men produce cloth, linen, silks, and it is a great merit on his part to have grasped this small amount! What he has not grasped is that these men, according to their abilities, also produce the social relationsamid which they prepare cloth and linen. Still less has he understood that men, who produce their social relations in accordance with their material productivity, also produce ideas, categories, that is to say the abstract ideal expressions of these same social relations. Thus the categories are no more eternal than the relations they express. They are historical and transitory products. To M. Proud¬hon, on the contrary, abstractions, categories are the primordial cause. According to him they, and not men, make history. Theabstraction, the category taken as such, i.e., apart from men and their material activities, is of course immortal, unchangeable, unmoved; it is only one form of the being of pure reason; which is only another way of saying that the abstraction as such is abstract. An admirable tautology!  \xa0\xa0\xa0Thus, regarded as categories, economic re1\'ations for M. Proudhon are eternal formulas without origin or progress.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * *  M. Proudhon is therefore necessarily doctrinaire. To him the historical movement, which is turning the present-day world upside down, reduces itself to the problem of discovering the correct equilibrium, the synthesis, of two bourgeois thoughts. And so the clever fellow by virtue of his subtlety discovers the hidden thought of God, the unity of two isolated thoughts which are only isolated because M. Proudhon has isolated them from practical life, from present-day production, which is the combination of the realities which they express. In place of the great historical movement arising from the conflict between the productive forces already acquired by men and their social relations, which no longer correspond to these productive forces; in place of the terrible wars which are being prepared between the different classes within each nation and between different nations; in place of the practical and violent action of the masses by which alone these conflicts can be resolved in place of this vast, prolonged and complicated movement, Monsieur Proudhon supplies the whimsical motion of his own head. So it is the men of learning that make history, the men who know how to purloin God\'s secret thoughts. The common people have only to apply their revelations. You will now understand why M. Proudhon is the declared enemy of every political movement. The solution of present problems does not lie for him in public action but in the dialectical rotations of his own head. Since to him the categories are the motive force, it is not necessary to change practical life in order to change the categories. Quite the contrary. One must change the categories and the consequence will be a change in the existing society.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In his desire to reconcile the contradictions Monsieur Proudhon does not even ask if the very basis of those contradictions must not be overthrown. He is exactly like the political doctrinaire who wants to have the king and the chamber of deputies and the chamber of peers as integral parts of social life, as eternal categories . All he is looking for is a new formula by which to establish an equilibriumbetween these powers whose equilibrium consists precisely in the actual movement in which one power is now the conqueror and now the slave of the other. Thus in the eighteenth century a number of mediocre minds were busy finding the true formula which would bring the social estates, nobility, king, parliament, etc., into equilibrium, and they woke up one morning to find that there was in fact no longer any king, parliament or nobility. The true equilibrium in this antagonism was the overthrow of all the social relations which served as a basis for these feudal existences and for the antagonisms of these feudal existences.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Because M. Proudhon places eternal ideas, the categories of pure reason, on the one side and h uman beings and their practical life, which, according to him is the application of these categories, on the other, one finds with him from the beginning a dualism between life and ideas, between soul and body, a dualism which recurs in many forms. You can see now that this antagonism is nothing butthe incapacity of M. Proudhon to understand the profane origin and the profane history of the categories which he deifies.  \xa0\xa0\xa0My letter is already too long for me to speak of the absurd case which M. Proudhon puts up against communism. For the moment you will grant me that a man who has not understood the present state of society may be expected to understand still less the movement which is tending to overthrow it, and the literary expressions of this revolutionary movement.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Thesole point on which I am in complete agreement with Monsieur Proudhon is in his dislike for sentimental socialistic day¬dreams. I had already, before him, drawn much enmity upon myself by ridiculing this sentimental, utopian, mutton-headed socialism. But is not M. Proudhon strangely deluding himself when he sets up his petty-bourgeois sentimentality-I am referring to his declamations about home, conjugal love and all such banalities-in opposition to socialist sentimentality, which in Fourier, for example goes much deeper than the pretentious platitudes of our worthy Proudhon? * * *  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Theses on Feuer bach  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 KARL MARX  Marx wrote the ""Theses \'on Feuerbach"" in the spring of 1845 as he and Engels were starting their collaborative work The German Ideology. More than forty years later, Engels found them in one of the notebooks that had come into his possession after his friend died. He published them as an appendix to his essay of 1888 on Ludwig Feuerbachand the End of Classical German Philosophy, and described them in the foreword to this essay as "" the brilliant germ of the new world outlook,"" They have fascinated Marx scholars ever since, and an extensive literature of exegesis of the ""Theses"" has accumulated. The eleventh thesis, in which Marx proclaims it the task of philosophy not simply to interpret but to change the world, is one of his most frequently quoted statements.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Before resorting to commentaries, however, the reader\' should apply himself to Marx\'s own amplification of the ""Theses"" in Part I of The German Ideology, which follows this selection.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Engels made a few small changes in the ""Theses"" when he published them in 1888: he added the phrase ""in Robert Owen, for example,"" in parentheses, at the end of the first paragraph of Thesis \' III; italicized ""social product"" in Thesis VII; italicized ""contemplative"" and placed quotation marks around ""civil society"" in Thesis IX, The version presented below is Marx\'s.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I  \xa0\xa0\xa0The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism that of Feuerbach includedis that the thing, reality, sensuousness, is conceived only in the form of the object or of contemplation, but not as human sensuous activity, practice, not subjectively. Hence it happened that the active side, in contradistinction to materialism, was developed by idealism-but only abstractly, since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous activity as such. Feuerbach wants sensuous objects, really distinct from the thought objects, but he does not conceive human activity itself as objective activity. Hence, in Das Wesen des Christentums, he regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human attitude, while practice is conceived and fixed only in its dirty-judaical manifestation. Hence he does not grasp the significance of ""revolutionary,"" of practicalcritical, activity.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0II \xa0\xa0\xa0The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question. Man must prove the truth, that is, the reality and power, the this-sided ness of his thinking in practice. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0III  \xa0\xa0\xa0The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of other circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that it is essential to educate the educator himself. Hence, this doctrine necessarily arrives at dividing society into two parts, one of which is superior to society .  \xa0\xa0\xa0The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionising practice.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0IV  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Feuerbach starts out from the fact of religious self-alienation, of the duplication of the world into a religious, imaginary world and a real one. His work consists in resolving the religious world into its secular basis. He overlooks the fact that after completing this work, the chief thing still remains to be done. For the fact that the secular basis detaches itself from itself and establishes itself in the clouds as an independent realm can only be explained by the cleavage and self-contradictions within this secular basis. The latter must itself, therefore, first be understood in its contradiction and then, by the removal of the contradiction, revolutionised in practice. Thus, for instance, after the earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, the former must then itself be criticised in theory and revolutionised in practice.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0V  \xa0Feuerbach, not satisfied with abstract thinking, appeals to sensuous contemplation; but he does not conceive sensuousness as practical, human sensuous activity.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0VI  \xa0\xa0\xa0Feuerbach resolves the religious essence into the human essence. But the human essence is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relations.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence, is consequently compelled:  \xa0\xa0\xa0 (1) To abstract from the historical process and to fix the religious sentiment as something by itself and to presuppose an abstract -isolated-human individual.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 (2) The human essence, therefore, can with him be comprehended only as ""genus,"" as an internal, dumb generality which merely naturally unites the many individuals.   \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0VII  \xa0\xa0\xa0Feuerbach, consequently, does not see that the ""religious sentiment"" is itself a social product, and that the abstract individual whom he analyses belongs in reality to a particular form of society.   \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0VIII  \xa0Social life is essentially practical.

He further explained: ""The manuscript, two large octavo volumes, had long reached its place of publication in Westphalia when we received the news that altered circumstances did not allow of its being printed. Vie abandoned the manuscript to the gnawing criticism of the mice, all the more willingly as we had achieved our main purpose self-clarification.""* The work was first published in 1932 by the Marx¬Engels Institute in Moscow.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The original difficulty of publication was very probably connected with the fact that most of this very bulky work consisted of satirically written, rather arid polemics against Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner, Karl Grun, and others. But Part I (here presented in full) is a different matter. Although polemical at various points, it is basically a work of exposition. It gives every appearance of being the work for which the ""Theses on Feuerbach"" served as an outline; hence we may infer that it was written by Marx. It is, in essence, a restatement, minus much of the German philosophical terminology, of the theory of history adumbrated in the manuscripts of 1 844. Marx now calls it the materialist conception of history."" It is particularly valuable and important to the student of Marxist thought because Marx never again set down a comprehensive statement of his theory of history at such length and in such detail. This point is not contradicted by Engels\' remark in the 1888 foreword that the exposihon of the materialist conception of history in The German Ideology ""proves only how incomplete our knowledge of economic history still was at that time.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0The German Ideology has recently appeared in a re-edited version containing several previously unknown pages of the manuscript that were discovered in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam, where the original manuscript is kept. Part I appears here in this new and fuller version as translated from the German and edited by S. Ryazanskaya, and published in English by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, in 1964. In preparing this new translation, the translator made use of an earlier English translation made by VI. Lough and edited by R. Pascal.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Feuerbach : Opposition of the Materialistic \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and Idealistic Outlook  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 As we hear from German ideologists, Germany has in the last few years gone through an unparalleled revolution. The decomposition of the Hegelian philosophy, which began with Strauss, has developed into a universal ferment into which all the ""powers of the past"" are swept. In the general chaos mighty empires have arisen only to meet with immediate doom, heroes have emerged momentarily only to be hurled back into obscurity by bolder and stronger rivals. It was a revolution beside which the French Revolution was child\'s play, a world struggle beside which the struggles of the Diadochi appear insignificant. Principles ousted one another, heroes of the mind overthrew each other with unheard-of rapidity, and in the three years 1842-45 more of the past was swept away in Germany than at other times inthree centuries.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0All this is supposed to have taken place in the realm of pure thought.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Certainly it is an interesting event we are dealing with: the putrescepc.e of the absolute spirit. When the last spark of its life had failed, the various components of this caput mortuum1 began to decompose, entered into new combinations and formed new substances. The industrialists of philosophy, who till then had lived on the exploitation of the absolute spirit, now seized upon the new combinations. Each with all possible zeal set about retailing h is apportioned share. This naturally gave rise to competition, which, to start with, was carried on in moderately staid bourgeois fashion. Later when the German market was glutted, and the commodity in spite of all efforts found no response in the world market, the business was spoiled in the usual German manner by fabricated and fictitious production, deterioration in quality, adulteration of the raw materials, falsification of labels, fictitious purchases, bill-jobbing and a credit system devoid of any real basis. The competition turned into a bitter struggle, which is now being extolled and interpreted to us as a revolution of world significance, the begetter of the most prodigious results and achievements.  \xa0\xa0\xa0If we wish to rate at its true value this philosophic charlatanry, which awakens even in the breast of the honest German citizen a glow of national pride, if we wish to bring out clearly the pettiness, the parochial narrowness of this whole Young-Hegelian movementand in particular the tragicomic contrast between the illusions of these heroes about their achievements and the actual achievements themselves, we must look at the whole spectacle from a standpoint beyond the frontiers of Germany.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0A. IDEOLOGY IN GENERAL, GERMAN IDEOLOGY \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0IN PARTICULAR  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0German criticism has, right up to its latest efforts, never quitted the realm of philosophy. Far from examining its general philosophic premises, the whole body of its inquiries has actually sprung from the soil of a definite philosophical system, that of Hegel. Not only in their answers but in their very questions there was a mystification. This dependence on Hegel is the reason why not one of these modern critics has even attempted a comprehensive criticism of the Hegelian system, however much each professes to have advanced beyond Hegel. Their polemics against Hegel and against one another are confined to this-each extracts one side of the Hegelian system and turns this against the whole system as well as against the sides extracted by the others. To begin with they extracted pure unfalsified Hegelian categories such as ""substance"" and ""self-consciousness,"" later they desecrated these categories with more secular names such as ""species,"" ""the Unique,"" ""Man,"" etc.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The entire body of German philosophical criticism from Strauss to Stirner is confined to criticism of religious conceptions. The critics started from real religion and actual theology. What religious consciousness and a religious conception really meant was determined variously as they went along. Their advance consisted in subsuming the allegedly dominant metaphysical, political, juridical, moral and other conceptions under the class of religious or theological, conceptions; and similarly in pronouncing political, juridical, moral consciousness as religious or theological, and the political, juridical, moral man-""man"" in the last resort as religious. The dominance of religion was taken for granted. Gradually every dominant relationship was pronounced a religious relationship and transformed into a cult, a cult of law, a cult of the State, etc. On all sides it was only a question of dogmas and belief in dogmas. The world was sanctified to an ever• increasing extent till at last our venerable Saint Max was able to canonise it en bloc and thus dispose of it once for all.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The Old Hegelians had comprehended everything as soon as it was reduced to an Hegelian logical category. The Young Hegelians criticized everything by attributing to it religious conceptions or by pronouncing it a theological matter. The Young Hegelians are in agreement with the Old Hegelians in their belief in the rule of religion, of concepts, of a universal principle in the existing world. Only, the one party attacks this dominion as usurpation, while the other extols it as legitimate.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Since the Young Hegelians consider conceptions, thoughts, ideas, in fact all the products of consciousness, to which they attribute an independent existence, as the real chains of men (just as the Old Hegelians declared them the true bonds of human society) it is evident that the Young Hegelians have to fight only against these illusions of the consciousness. Since, according to their fantasy, the relationships of men, all their doings, their chains and their limitations are products of their consciousness, the Young Hegelians logically put to men the moral postulate of exchanging their present consciousness for human, critical or egoistic consciousness, and thus of removing their limitations. This demand to change consciousness amounts to a demand to interpret reality in another way, i.e., to recognise it by means of another interpretation. The Young Hegelian ideologists, in spite of their allegedly ""world-shattering"" statements, are the staunchest conservatives. The most recent of them have found the correct expression for their activity when they declare they are only fighting against ""phrases."" They forget, however, that to these phrases they themselves are only opposing other phrases, and that they are in no way combating the real existing world when they are merely combating the phrases of this world. The only results which this philosophic criticism could achieve were a few ( and at that thoroughly one-sided) elucidations of Christianity from the point of view of religious history; all the rest of their assertions are only further embellishments of their claim to have furnished, in these unimportant elucidations, discoveries of universal importance.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It has not occurred to any one of these philosophers to inquire into the connection of German philosophy with German reality, the relation of their criticism to their ownmaterial surroundings.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones, notdogmas, but real premises from which abstraction can only be made in the imagination. They are the realindividuals, their activity and the material conditions under which they live, both thosewhich they find already existing and those produced by their active-ity. These premises can thus be verified in a purely empirical way.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established isthe physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature. Of course, we cannot here go either into the actual physical nature of man, or into the natural conditions in which man finds himself geological, orohydrographical,climatic and so on. The writing of history must always set out from these natural bases and their modification in the course of history through the action of men.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organization. By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The way in which men produce their means of subsistence depends first of all on the nature of the actual means of subsistence they find in existence and have to reproduce. This mode of production must not be considered simply as being the reproduction of the physical existence of the individuals. Rather it is a definite form of activity of these individuals, a definite form of expressing their life, a definite mode of life on their part. As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with howthey produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This production only makes its appearance with  the increase of population. In its turn this presupposes the intercourse of individuals with one another. The form of this intercourse is again determined by production.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The relations ofdifferent nations among themselves depend upon the extent to which each has developed its productive forces, the division of labour and internal intercourse. This statement is generally recognised. But not onlythe relation of one nation to others, but also the whole internal structure of the nation itself depends on the stage of development reached by its production and its internal and external intercourse. How far the productive forces of a nation are developed is shown most manifestly by the degree to which the division of labour has been carried. Each new productice force, insofar as it is not merely a quantitive extension of productive forces already known ( for instance the bringing into cultivation of fresh land ), causes a further development of the divisionof labour.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The division of labour inside a nation leads at first to the separation of industrial and commercial fromagricultural labour, and hence to the separationof town and country and to  the conflict of their interests. Its further development leads to the separation ofcommercial from industrial labour. At the same time through the division of labour inside these various branches there develop various divisions among the individuals co-operating in definite kinds of labour. The relative position of these individual groups is determined by the methods employed in agriculture, industry and commerce ( patriarchalism, slavery, estates, classes ). These same conditions are to be seen (given a more developed intercourse) in the relations of different nations to one another.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The various stages of development in the division of labour are just so many different forms of ownership, i.e., the existing stage in the division of labour determines also the relations of individuals to one another with reference to the material, instrument, and product of labour.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The first form of ownership is tribal  ownership. It corresponds to the undeveloped stage of  production, at which a people lives by hunting and fishing, by the rearing of beasts or, in the highest stage, agriculture. In the latter case it pre-supposes a great mass of uncultivated stretches of land. The division of labour is at this stage still very elementary and is confined to a further extension of the natural division of labour existing in the family. The social structure is, therefore, limited to an extension of the family; patriarchal family chieftains, below them the members of the tribe; finally slaves. The slavery latent in the family only develops gradually with the increase of population, the growth of wants, and with the extension of external relations, both of war and of barter.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The second form is the ancient communal and State ownership which  proceeds especially from the union of several tribes into a city by agreement or by conquest, and which is still accompanied by slavery. Beside communal ownership we already find movable,and later also immovable, private property developing, but as an abnormal form subordinate to communal ownership. The citizens hold power over their labouring slaves only in their community, and on this account alone, therefore, they are bound to the form of communal ownership. It is the communal private property which compels the active citizens to remain in this spontaneously derived form of association over against their slaves. For this reason the whole structure of society based on this communal ownership, and with it the power of the people, decays in the same measure as; in particular, immovable private property evolves. The division of labour is already more developed. We already find the antagonismof town and country; later the antagonism between those states which represent town interests and those which represent country interests, and inside the towns themselves the antagonism between industry and maritime commerce. The class relation between citizens and slaves is now completely developed.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This whole interpretation of history appears to be contradicted by the fact of conquest. Up till now violence, war, pillage, murder and robbery, etc., have been accepted as the driving force of history. Here we must limit ourselves to the chief points and take, therefore, only the most striking example--:the destruction of an old civilisation by a barbarous people and the resulting formation of an entirely new organisation of society. ( Rome and the barbarians; feudalism and Gaul; the Byzantine Empire and the Turks.) With the conquering barbarian people war itself is still, as indicated above, a regular form of intercourse; which is the more eagerly exploited as the increase in population together with the traditional and, for it, the only possible, crude mode of production gives rise to the need for new means of production. In Italy, on the other hand, the concentration of landed property (caused not only by buying-up and indebtedness but also by inheritance, since loose living being rife and marriage rare, the old families gradually died out and their possessions fell into the hands of a few) and its conversion into grazing land (caused not only by the usual economic forces still operative today but by the importation of plundered and tribute corn and the resultant lack of demand for Italian corn) brought about the almost total disappearance of the free population. The very slaves died out again and again, and had constantly to be replaced by new ones. Slavery remained the basis of the whole productive system. The plebeians, midway between freemen and slaves, never succeeded in becoming more than a proletarian rabble. Rome indeed never became more than a city; its connection with the provinces was almost exclusively political and could, therefore, easily be broken again by political events.  \xa0\xa0\xa0With the development of private property, we find here for the first time the same conditions which we shall find again, only on a more extensive scale, with modern private property. On the one hand, the concentration of private property, which began very early in Rome ( as the Licinian agrarian law proves ) and proceeded very rapidly \'from the time of the civil wars and especially under the Emperors; on the other hand, coupled with this, the transformation of the plebejan small peasantry into a proletariat, which, however, owing To its intermediate position between propertied citizens and slaves, never achieved an independent development.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The third form of ownership is feudal or estate property. If antiquity started out from the town and its little territory, the Middle Ages started out from the country. This different starting point was determined by the sparseness of the population at that time, which was scattered over a large area and which received no large increase from the conquerors. In contrast to Greece and Rome, feudal development at the outset, therefore, extends over a much wider territory, prepared by the Roman conquests and the spread of agriculture at first associated with them. The last centuries of the declining Roman Empire and its conquest by the bar barbar-ians destroyed a number of productive forces; agriculture had declined, industry had decayed for want of a market, trade had died out or been violently suspended, the rural and urban population had decreased. From these conditions and the mode of organisation of the conquest determined by them, feudal property developed under the infiluence of the Germanic military constitution. Like tribal and communal ownership, it is based again on a community; but the directlyproducing class standing over against it is not, as in the case of the ancient community, the slaves, but theenserfed small peasantry. As soon as feudalism is fully developed, there also arises antagonism to the towns. The hierarchical structure oflandownership, and the armed bodies of retainers associated with it, gave the nobility power over the serfs. This feudal organisation was, just as much as the ancient communal ownership, an association against a subjected producing class; but the form of associtation and the relation to the direct producers were differentbecause of the different conditions of production. This feudal system of landownership had its counterpart in thetowns in the shape of corporative property, the feudal organisationof trades.Here property consisted chIefly in the Ia hour of each •individual person. The necessity for association against the organised robber nobility, the need for communal covered markets in an age when the industrialist was at the same time a merchant, the growing competition of the escaped serfs swarming into the rising towns, the feudal structure of the whole country: these combined to bring about the  guilds. The gradually accumulated small capital of individual craftsmen and their stable numbers, as against the growing population, evolved the relation of journeyman and apprentice, which brought into being in the towns a hierarchy similar to that in the country.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Thus the chief form of  property during the feudal epoch consisted on the one hand of landed property with serf labour chainedto it, and on the other of the labour of the individual with small capital commanding the labour of journeymen. The organization ofboth was determined by the restricted conditions of production the small-scale and primitive cultivation of the land, alld-Ihe craft type of industry. There was little division of labour in the heyday of feudalism. Each country bore in itself the antithesis of town and country; the division into estates was certainly strongly marked; but apart from the differentiation of princes, nobility, clergy and peasants in the country, and masters, journeymen, apprentices and soon also the rabble of casual labourers in the towns, no division of importance took place. In agriculture it was rendered difficult by the strip-system, beside which the cottage industry of the peasants themselves emerged. In industry there wasno division of labour at all in the individual trades themselves, and very little between them. The separation of industry and commerce was found already in existence in older towns; in the newer it only developed later, when the towns entered into mutual relations.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The grouping of larger territories into feudal kingdoms was a necessity for the landed nobility as for the towns. The organisation of the ruling class, the nobility, had, therefore, everywhere a monarch at its head.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The fact is, therefore, that definite individuals who are productively active in a definite way enter into these definite social and political relations. Empirical observation must in each separate instance bring out empirically, and without any mystification and speculation, the connection of the social and political structure with production. The social structure and the State are continually evolving out of the life process of definite individuals, but of individuals, not as they may appear in their own or other people\'s imagination, but as they really are; i.e., as they operate, produce materially, and hence as they work under definite material limits, presuppositions and conditions independent of their will.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The production of ideas, of conceptions, of consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the material activity and the material intercourse of men, the language of real life. Conceiving, thinking, the mental intercourse of men, appear at this stage as the direct efflux of their material behaviour. The same applies to mental production as expressed in the language of politics, laws, morality, religion, metaphysics, etc., of a people. Men are the producers of their conceptions, ideas:Is, etc-real, active men, as they are conditioned by a definite deve1opment of their productlve forces  and of the intercourse corresponding to these, up to its furthest forms. Consciousness can never be anything else than conscious existence andthe existence of men is their actual life-process. If in all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside-down as in a camera obscura, this phenomenon arises just as much from their historical life-process as the inversion of objects on the retina does from their physical life-process.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from Hayen to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from .what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the develop¬ment of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life-process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness,thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life. In the first method of approach the starting point is consciousness taken as the living individual; in the second method, which conforms to real life, it is the real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This method of approach is not devoid of premises. It starts out from the real premises and does not abandon them for a moment. Its premises are men, not in any fantastic isolation and rigidity, but in their actual, empirically perceptible process of development under definite conditions. As soon as this active life-process is described, history ceases to be a collection of dead facts as it is with the empiricists ( themselves still abstract), or an imagined activity of imagined subject, as with the idealists.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Where speculation ends-in real life-there real, positive science begins : the representation of the practical activity, of the practical, process of development of men. Empty talk about consciousness ceases, and real knowledge has to take its place. When reality is depicted, philosophy as an independent branch of knowledge loses its medium of existence. At the best its place can only be taken by summing up of the most general results, abstractions which arise from the observation of the historical development of men. Viewed apart from real history, these\' abstractions have in themselves no value whatsoever. They can only serve to facilitate the arrangement of historical material, to indicate the sequence of its separate strata.But they by no means afford a recipe or schema, as does philosophy, for neatly trimming the epoch of history. On the contrary,our difficulties begin only when we set about the observation and the arrangement the real depiction of our historical material,whether of a past epoch or of the present. The removal of these difficulties is governed by premises which it is quite impossible to state here, but which only the study of the actual life-process arid the activity of the individuals of each epoch will make evident. We shall select here some of these abstractions, which we use in contradistioncion to the ideologists, and shall iilustrate them by historical examples.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa01. History  \xa0\xa0\xa0Since we are dealing with the Germans, who are devoid of premises, we must begin by stating the first premise of all human existence and, therefore, of all history, the premise, namely, that men,must be in a position to live in order to be able to ""makehistory.’’2 But life involves before everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things. Tne first historical act is thus the production of the means to satisfy these needs, the production of material life itself. And indeed this is an histori¬cal act, a fundamental condition of all history, which today, as thousands of years ago, must daily and hourly be fulfilled merely in order to sustain human life. Even when the sensuous world is reduced to a minimum, to a stick as with Saint Bruno, it presup¬poses the action of producing the stick. Therefore in any interpretation of history one has first of all to observe this fundamental fact in all its significance and all its implications and to accord it its due importance. It is well known that the Germans have never done this, and they have never, therefore, had an earthly basis for history and consequently never a historian.The French and the English, even if they have conceived the relation of this fact with so-calledhistory only in an extremely one-sided fashion, particularly as long as they remained in the toils of political ideology, have nevertheless made the first attempts to give the writing of history a materialistic basis by being the first to write histories of civil society, of commerce and industry.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The second point is that the satisfaction of the first need ( theaction of satisfying, and the instrument of satisfaction which has been acquired) leads to new needs; and this production of newneeds is the first historical act. Here we recognise immediately the spiritual ancestry of the great historical wisdom of the Germans who, when they run out of positive material and when they can serve up neither theological nor political nor literary rubbish, assert that this is not history at all, but the ""prehistoric era."" They do not, however, enlighten us as to how we proceed from this nonsensical ""prehistory"" to history proper; although, on the other hand, in their historical speculation they seize upon this ""prehistory"" with especial eagerness because they imagine themselves safe there from interference on the part of ""crude facts,"" and, at the same time, because there they can give full rein to their speculative impulse and set up and knock down hypotheses by the thousand.The third circumstance which, from the very outset, enters into historical development, is that men, who daily remake their own life, begin to make other men, to propagate their kind: the relation between man and woman, parents and children, the family. The family, which to begin with is the .only social relationship, becomes later, when increased needs create new social relatIons and the increased population new needs, a subordinate one ( except in Germany), and must then be  treated and analysed according to the existing empirical data, not according to ""the concept of the family,"" as is the custom in Germany.3 These three aspects of social activity are not of course to be taken as three different stages, but just as three aspects or, to make it clear to the Germans, three ""moments,"" which have existed simultaneously since the dan ofhistory and the first men, and which still assert themselves in history today.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The production of life, both of one\'s own in labour and of fresh  life in procreation, now appears as a double relationship: on the one hand as a natural, on the other as a social relationship. By social we understand the co-operation of several individuals, no matter under what conditions, in what manner and to what end. It follows from this that a certain mode, of production, or industrial stage, is always combined with a certain mode of co-operation, or social stage, and this mode of co-operation \' is itself a ""productive force."" Further, that the multitude of productive forces accessible to men determines the nature of society, hence, that the ‘’history humanity’’ must always be studied and treated in relation to thehistory of industry and exchange. But it is also clear how in Germany it is impossible to write this sort of history, because the Germans lack not only the necessary power of comprehension and the material but also the ""evidence of their senses,"" for across the Rhine you cannot have any experience of these things since history has stopped happening. Thus it is quite obvious from the start that there exists a materialistic connection of men with one another, which is determined by their needs and their mode of production, and which is as old as men themselves. This connection is evertaking on new forms, and thus presents a ‘’history’’ independentlyof the existence of any political or religious nonsense which would especially hold men together.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Only now, after having considered four moments, four aspects ofthe primary historical relationships, do we find that man also possesses “consciousness”;4 but, even so, not inherent, not ""pure"" consciousness. From the start the ""spirit"" is afflicted with the curse of being ""burdened"" with matter, which here makes its appearance in the form of agitated layers of air, sounds, in short, of language. Language is as old as consciousness, language is practical conscious¬ness that exists also for other men, and for that reason alone it really exists for me personally as well; language, like consciousness, only arises from the need, the necessity, of intercourse with other men. Where there exists a relationship, it exists for me : the animal does not enter into ""relations"" with anything, it does not enter into any relation at all. For the animal, its relation to others does not exist as a relation. Consciousness is, therefore, from the very beginning a social product, and remains so as long as men exist at all. Consiousness is at first, of course, merely consciousness concerning the immediate sensous environment and consciousness of the limited connection with other persons and things outside the individual who"" is growing self-conscious. At the same time it is consciousness of nature, which first appears to men as a completely alien, all-powerful and unassailable force, with which men\'s relations are purely animal and by which they are overawed like beasts; it is thus a purely animal consciousnessof nature (natural religion).  \xa0\xa0\xa0We see here immediately: this natural religion or this particular relation of men to nature is determined by the form of society and vice versa. Here, as everywhere, the identity of nature and man appears in such a way that the restricted relation of men to nature determines their restricted relation to one another, and their restricted relation to one another determines men\'s restricted relation to nature, just because nature is as yet hardly modified historically; and, on the other hand, man\'s consciousness of the necessity of associating with the individuals around him is the beginning of he consciousness that he is living in society at all. This beginning is as animal as social life itself at this stage. It is mere herd-consciousness, and at this point man is only distinguished from sheep by the fact that with him consciousness takes the place of instinct or that his instinct is a conscious one. This sheep-like or tribal consciousness receives its further development and extension through increasedprodyctivity, the increase of needs, and, what isfundamental to both of these, the increase of population. With these there develops the division of labour, which was originally nothing but the division of labour in the sexual act, then that division of labour which develops spontaneously or ""naturally"" by virtue of natural predisposition (e.g., physical strength), needs, accidents, etc., etc. Division of labour only becomes truly such from the moment when a division of material and mental labour appears.5 Fromt this moment onwards consciousness can really Ratler""Itself that it is something other than consciousness of existing practice, that it really represents something without represent- ing something real; from now on consciousness is in a position to emancipate itself from the world and to proceed to the formation of ""pure"" theory, theology, philosophy, ethics, etc. But even if this theory, theology, philosophy, ethics, etc., comes into contrawith the existing relations, this c    only occur because existing social relations have come into contradiction with existing forces of production; this, moreover, can also occur in a particular national sphere of\'relations through the appearance of the contradiction, not within the national orbit, but between this national consciousness and the practice of other nations,6 i.e., between the national and the general consciousness of a nation (as we see it now in Germany).  \xa0\xa0\xa0Moreover, it is quite immaterial what consciousness starts to do on its own: out of all such muck we get only the one inference that these threeoments, the forces of production, the state of society, and consciousness, can and must come into contradicfion with one another, because the division of labour implies the possibility,naythe fact that intellectual and material activity-enjoyment and labour, production and consumption devolve on different individuals, and that the only possibility of their not coming into contradiction lies in the negation in its turn of the division of labour. It is self-evident, moreover, that ""spectres,"" ""bonds,"" ""the higherbeing,"" ""concept,"" ""scruple,"" are merely the idealistic, spiritual expression, the conception apparently of the isolated individual, the image of very empirical fetters and limitations, within which the mode of production of life and the form of intercourse coupled with it move.  \xa0\xa0\xa0With the division of labour, in which all these contradictions are implicit, and which in its turn is based on the natural division of labour in the family and the separation of society into individual. families opposed to one another, is given simultaneously thedistri-bution, and indeed the unequal distribution, both quantitive and qualitative, of labour and its products, hence property: the nucleus, the first form, of which lies in the family, where wife and children are the slaves of the husband. This latent slavely in the family, though still very crude, is the first property, but even at this early stage it corresponds perfectly to the definition of modern economists who call it the power of disposing of the labour-power of others. Division of labour and private property are, moreover, identical expressions: in the one the same thing is affirmed with reference to activity as is affirmed in the other with reference to the product of the activity.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Further, the division of labour implies the contradiction between the interest of the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of all individuals who have intercourse with one another. And indeed, this communal interest does not exist merely in the imagination, as the ""general interest,"" but first of all in reality, as the mutual interdependence of the individuals among whom the labour is divided. And finally, the division of labour offers us the first example of how, as long as man remains in natural society, that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particu¬voluntarily, but naturally, divided, man’s own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a shepherd, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, shepherd or critic. This fixation of social activity, this consolidation of what we ourselves produce intoan objective power above us, growing out of control, thwarting our expectations, bringing to naught our calculations, is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now.  \xa0\xa0\xa0And out of this very contradiction between the interest of the individual and that of the community the latter takes an independent form as theState, divorced from the real interests of individual and community, and at the same time as an illusory communal life, always based, however, on the real ties existing in every family and tribal conglomeration-such as flesh and blood, language, division of labour on a larger scale, and other interests and especial1y, as we shall enlarge upon later, on the classes, already determined by the division of labour, which in every such mass of men separate out, and of which one dominates all the others. It follows from this that all struggles within the State, the struggle between democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy, the struggle for the franchise, etc., etc.,are merely the illusory forms in which the real struggles of the different classes are fought out among one another (of this the German theoreticians have nof the fainest inkling, although they have received a sufficient introduction to the subject in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher and Die heilige Familie). Further, it follows that every class which is struggling for mastery, even when its domination, as is the case with the proletariat, postulates the abolition of the old form of society in its entirety and of domination itself, must first conquer for itself political power in order to represent its interest in turn as the general interest, which in the first moment it is forced to do. Just because individuals seek only their particular interest, which for them does not coincide with their communal interest (in fact the general is the illusory form of communal life), the latter will be imposed on them as an interest ""alien"" to them, and ""independent"" of them, as in its turn a particular, peculiar ""general"" interest; or they themselves must remain within this discord, as in democracy. On the other hand, too, the practicalstruggle of these particular interests, which constantly really run counter to the communal and illusory communal interests, makes practical intervention and control necessary through the illusory ‘’general’’ interest in the form of the State, The social power, i.e., the multiplied productive force, which arises through the the co-operation of different  individuals as it is determined by the division of labour, appears to these individuals, since their co-operation is not voluntary but has come about naturally, not as their own united power, but as an alien forceexisting outside them, of the origin and goal of which they are ignorant, which they thus cannot control, which on the contrary passes through a peculiar series of phases and stages independent of the will and the action of man, nay even being the prime governor of these.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This’’estrangement’’ (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of course, only be abolished given two practical premises. For it to become an ""intolerable"" power, i.e., a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity ""propertyless,"" and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development. And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, because only with this universal development of productive forces isa universal intercourse between men established, which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the ""propertyless"" mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical,  empirically universal individuals in place of local ones. Without this, ( 1)communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism. Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples ""all at once"" and simultaneously, which presupposes the universaldevelopment of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism. How otherwise ccould for instance property have had a history at all, have taken on different forms, and landed property, for example, according to the different premises given, have proceeded in France from parcellation to centralisation in the hands of a few, in England from centralisation in the hands of a few to parcellation, as is actually the case today? Or how does it happen that trade, which after all is nothing more than the exchange of products of various individuals and countries, rules the whole world through the relation of supply and demand-a relation which, as an English economist says, hovers over the earth like the fate of the ancients, and with invisible hand allots fortune and misfortune to men, sets up empires and overthrows empires, causes nations to rise and to disappear while with the abolition of the basis of private property, with the communistic regulation of production (and, implicit in this, the destruction of the alien relation between men and what they themselves produce), the power of the relation of supply and demand is dissolved into nothing, and men get exchange, production, the mode of their mutual relation, under their own control again? \xa0\xa0\xa0Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to b established, an ideal to which reality  have to adjust itself.We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence. Moreover, the mass of propertylessworkers-the utterly precarious position of labour-power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life-presupposes the world market through competition. The proletariat can thus only exist world-historically, just as communism, its activity, can only have a ""world-historical"" existence. World-historical existence of individuals, i.e., existenceof individuals which is directly linked up with world history.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The form of intercourse determined by the existing productive forces af all previous historical stages, and in its turn determingthese, is civil society. The latter, as is clear from what we have said above, has as its premises and basis the simple family and the multiple, the so-called tribe, and the more precise determinants of this society are enumerated in our remarks above. Already here we see how this civil society is the true source and theatre of all history, and how absurd is the conception of history held hitherto, which neglects the real relationships and confines itself to high-sounding dramas of princes and states.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Civil society embraces the whole material intercourse of individuals within a definite stage of the development of productive forces.It embraces the whole commercial and industrial life of a given stage and, insofar, transcends the State and the nation, though on the other hand again, it must assert itself in its foreign relations as nationality, and inwardly must organise itseld as State. The term ‘’civil society’’ 7 emerged in the eighteenth century, when property relationships had already extricated themselves from the ancient and medieval communal society. Civil society as such only develops with the bourgeoisie; the social organisation evolving directly out of production and commerce, which in all ages forms the basis of the State and of the rest of the idealistic superstructure, has, however, always been designated by the same name.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa02. Concerning the Production of Consciousness  \xa0\xa0\xa0In history up to the present it is certainly an empirical fact that separate individuals have, with the broadening of their activity into world historical activity, become more and more enslaved under a power alien to them (a pressure which they have conceived of as a dirty trick on the part of the so-called universal spirit, etc.), a power which has become more and more enormous and, in the last instance, turns out to be the world market. But it is just as empirically established that, by the overthrow of the existing state of society by the communist revolution (of which more below) and the abolition of private property which is identical with it, this power, which so baffles the German theoreticians, will be dissolved; and that then the liberation of each single individual will be accomplished in the measure in which history becomes transformed into world history. From the above it is clear that the real intellectual wealth of the individual depends entirely on the wealth of his real connections. Only then will the separate individuals be liberated from the various national and local barriers, be brought into practical connection with the material and intellectual production of the whole world and be put in a position to acquire the capacity to enjoy this all-sided production of the whole earth (the creations of man). All-round dependence, this natural form of the world¬historical co-operation of individuals, will be transformed by this communist revolution into the control and conscious mastery of these powers, which, born of the action of men on one another, have till now overawed and governed men as powers completely alien to them. Now this view can be expressed again in speculative-idealistic, i.e., fantastic, terms as ""self-generation of the species"" (""society as the subject""), and thereby the consecutive series of interrelated individuals connected with each other can be conceived as a single individual, which accomplishes the mystery of generating itself, It is clear here that individuals certainly make one another, physically and mentally, but do not make themselves either in the nonsense of Saint Bruno, or in the sense of the ""Unique,"" of the ""made"" man.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This conception of history depends on our ability to .expound the real process of production, starting out from the material production of life itself, and to comprehend the form of intercourse connected with this and created by this mode of production (i.e., civil society in its various stages), as the basis of all history; and to show it in its action as State, to explain all the different theoretical products and forms of consciousness, religion, philosophy, ethics, etc., etc., and trace their origins and growth from that basis; by which means, of course, the whole thing can be depicted in its totality (and therefore, too, the reciprocal action of these various sides on one another). It has not, like the idealistic view of  history, in every period to look for a category, but remains constantly on the real ground of history; it does not explain practice from the idea but explains the formation of ideas from material practice; and accordingly it comes to the conclusion that all forms and products of consciousness cannot be dissolved by mental criticism, by resolution into ""self-consciousness"" or transformation into ""apparitions,"" ""spectres,"" ""fancies,"" etc., but only by the practical overthrow of the actual social relations which gave rise to this idealistic humbug; that not criticism but revolution is the driving force of history, also of religion, of philosophy and all other types of theory. It shows that history does not end by being resolved into ""self¬consciousness"" as ""spirit of the spirit,"" but that in it at each stage there is found a material result: a sum of productive forces, a historically created relation of individuals to nature and to one another, which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor; a mass of productive forces, capital funds and conditions, which, on the one hand, is indeed modified by the new generation,but also on the other prescribes for it its conditions of life and gives it a definite development, a special character. It shows that circumstances make men just as m uch as men make circumstances. This sum of productive forces, capital funds and social forms of intercourse, which every individual and generation finds in existence as something given, is the real basis of what the philosophers have conceived as ""substance"" and ""essence of man,"" and what they have deified and attacked: a real basis which is not in the least disturbed, in its effect and influence on the development of men, by the fact that these philosophers revolt against it as ""self¬consciousness"" and the ""Unique."" These conditions of life, which different generations find in existence, decide also whether or not the periodically recurring revolutionary convulsion will be strong enough to overthrow the basis of the entire existing system. And if these material elements of a complete revolution are not present ( namely, on the one hand the existing productive forces, on the other the formation of a revolutionary mass, which revolts not only against separate conditions of society up till then, but against the very ""production of life"" till then, the ""total activity"" on which it was based), then, as far as practical development is concerned, it is absolutely immaterial whether the idea of this revolution has been expressed a hundred times already, as the history of communism proves.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In the whole conception of history up to the present this real basis of history has either been totally neglected or else considered as a minor matter quite irrelevant to the course of history. History must, therefore, always be written according to an extraneous standard; the real production of life seems to be primeval history, while the truly historical appears to be separated from ordinary life, something extra-superterrestrial. With this the relation of man to nature is excluded from history and hence the antithesis of nature and history is created. The exponents of this conception of history have consequently only been able to see in history the political actions of princes and States, religious and all sorts of theoretical struggles, and in particular in each historical epoch have had to share the illusion of that epoch. For instance, if an epoch imagines itself to be actuated by purely ""political"" or ""religious"" motives, although ""religion"" and ""politics"" are only forms of its true motives, the historian accepts this opinion. The ""idea,"" the ""conception"" of the people in question about their real practice, is transformed into the sole determining, active force, which controls and determines their practice. When the crude form in which the division of labour appears with the Indians and Egyptians calls forth the caste-system in their State and religion, the historian believes that the caste-system is the power which has produced this crude social form . While the French and the English at least hold by the political illusion, which is moderately close to reality, the Germans move in the realm of the ""pure spirit,"" and make religious illusion the driving force of history. The Hegelian philosophy of history is the last consequence, reduced to its ""finest expression,"" of all this German historiography, for which it is not a question of real, nor even of political, interests, but of pure thoughts, which consequently must appear to Saint Bruno, as a series of ""thoughts"" that devour one another and are finally swallowed up in ""self¬consciousness"";8 and even more consistently the course of history appears to the Blessed Max Stirner, who knows not a thing about real history, as a mere tale of ""knights,"" robbers and ghosts, from whose visions he can, of course, only save himself by ""unholiness."" This conception is truly religious: it postulates religious man as the primitive man, the starting point of history; and in its imagination puts the religious production of fancies in the place of the real production of the means of subsistence and of life itself. This whole conception of history, together with its dissolution and the scruples and qualms resulting from it, is a purely national affair of the Germans and has only local interest for the Germans, as for instance the important question treated several times of late: how really we ""pass from the realm of God to the realm of Man"" -as if this ""realm of God"" had ever existed anywhere save in the imagination, and the learned gentlemen, without being aware of it, were not constantly living in the ""realm of Man"" to which they are now seeking the way; and as if the learned pastime ( for it is nothing more) of explaining the mystery of this theoretical bubble-blowing did not on the contrary lie in demonstrating its origin in actual earthly conditions. Always, for these Germans, it is simply a matter of resolving the nonsense of earlier writers into some other freak, i.e., of presupposing that all this nonsense has a special sense which can be discovered; while really it is only a question of explaining this theoretical talk from the actual existing conditions. The real, practical dissolution of these phrases, the removal of these notions from the consciousness of men, will, as we have already said, be effected by altered circumstances, not by theoretical deductions. For the mass of men, i.e., the proletariat, these theoretical notions do not exist and hence do not require to be dissolved, and if this mass ever had any theoretical notions, e .g., religion, etc., these have now long been dissolved by circumstances.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The purely national character of these questions and solutions is shown again in the way these theorists believe in all seriousness that chimeras like ""the God-Man,"" ""Man,"" etc., have presided overindividual epochs of history (Saint Bruno even goes so far as to assert that ""only criticism and critics have made history"") and when they themselves construct historical systems, they skip over all earlier periods in the greatest haste and pass immediately from ""Mongolism"" to history ""with meaningful content,"" that is to say, to the history of the Hallische and Deutsche Jahrbucher and the dis¬solution of the Hegelian school into a general squabble. They forget all other nations, all real events, and the theatrum mundi is confined to the Leipzig Book Fair and the mutual quarrels of ""Criticism,"" ""Man,"" and ""the Unique."" If these theorists treat really historical subjects, as for instance the eighteenth centrry, they merely give a history of the i deas of the times, torn away from the facts and the practical development fundamental to them; and even that merely in order to represent that period as an imperfect preliminary stage, the as yet limited predecessor of the real historical age, i.e., the period of the German philosophic struggle from 1840 to 1844. As might be expected when the history of an earlier period is written with the aim of accentuating the brilliance of anun historic person and his fantasies, all the really historic events, even the really historic invasion of politics into history, receive no mention. Instead we get a narrative based not on research but on arbitrary constructions and literary gossip, such as Saint Bruno provided in his now forgotten history of the eighteenth century. These high-falutin and haughty hucksters of ideas, who imagine themselves infinitely exalted above all national prejudices, are thus in practice far more national than the beer-quaffing philistines who dream of a united Germany. They do not recognise the deeds of other nations as historical: they live in Germany, to Germany, and for Germany; they turn the Rhine-song into a religious hymn and conquer Alsace and Lorraine by robbing French philosophy instead of the French State, by Germanising French ideas instead of French provinces. Herr Venedey is a cosmopolitan compared with the Saints B runo and Max, who, in the universal dominance of theory, proclaim the universal dominance of Germany.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is also clear from these arguments how grossly Feuerbach is deceiving himself when (Wigand\'s Vierteljahrsschrift, 1845, Volume 2) by virtue of the qualification ""common man"" he declares himself a communist, transforms the latter into a predicate of ""man,"" and thereby thinks it possible to change the word ""communist,"" which in the real world means the follower of a definite revolutionary party, into a mere category. Feuerbach\'s whole deduction with regard to the relation of men to one another goes only so far as to prove that men need and alwayshave needed each other. He wants to est a blish consciousness of this fact, that is to say, like the other theorists, merely to produce a correct consciousness aboutan existing fact; whereas for the real communist it is a question of overthrowing the existing state of things. We thoroughly appreciate, moreover, that Feuerbach, in endeavouring to produce consciousness of just this fact, is going as far as a theorist possibly can, without ceasing to be a theorist and philosopher. It is characteristic, however, that Saint Bruno and Saint Max seize on Feuerbach\'s conception of the communist and put it in place of the real communist which occurs, partly, in order that they can combat communism too as ""spirit of the spirit,"" as a philosophical category, as an equal opponent and, in the case of Saint Bruno, partly also for pragmatic reason. As an example of Feuerbach\'s acceptance and at the same time misunderstanding of existing reality, which he still shares with our opponents, we recall the passage in the Philosophie der Zukunft where he develops the view that the existence of a thing or a man is at the same time its or his essence, that the conditions of existence, the mode of life and activity of an animal or human individual are those in which its ""essence"" feels itself satisfied. Here every exception is expressly conceived as an unhappy chance, as an abnormality which cannot be altered. Thus if millions of proletarians feel by no means contented with their living conditions, if their ""existence"" does not in the least correspond to their ""essence,"" then, according to the passage quoted, this is an unavoidable misfortune, which must be borne quietly. The millions of proletarians and communists, however, think differently and will prove this in time, when they bring their ""existence"" into harmony with their ""essence"" in a practical way, by means of a revolution. Feuerbach, therefore, never speaks of the world of man in such cases, but always takes refuge in external nature, and moreover in nature which has not yet been subdued by men. But every new invention, every advance made by industry, detaches another piece from this domain, so that the ground which produces examples illustrating such Feuerbachian propositions is steadily shrinking. The ""essence"" of the fish is its ""existence,"" water to go no further than this one proposition. The ""essence"" of the freshwater fish is the water of a river. But the latter ceases to be the ""essence"" of the fish and is no longer a suitable medium of existence as soon as the river is made to serve industry, as soon as it is polluted by dyes and other waste products and navigated by steamboats, or as soon as its water is diverted into canals where simple drainage can deprive the fish of its medium of existence. The explanation that all such contradictions are inevitable abnormalities does not essentially differ from the consolation which the Blessed Max Stirner offers to the discontented, saying that this contradiction is their own contradiction and this predicament their own predicament,whereupon they should either set their minds at ease, keep their disgust to themselves, or revolt against it in some fantastic way. It differs just as little from Saint Bruno\'s allegation that these unfortunate circumstances are due to the fact that those concerned are stuck in the muck of ""substance,"" have not advanced to ""absolute self-consciousness,"" and do not realise that these adverse conditions are spirit of their spirit.  \xa0\xa0\xa0We shall, of course, not take the trouble9 to enlighten our wise philosophers by explaining to them that the ""liberation"" of ""man"" is not advanced a single stepl by reducing philosophy, theology, substance and all the trash to ""self-consciousness""2 and by liberating man from the domination of these phrases,3 which have never held him in thrall.4 Nor will we explain to them that it is only possible to achieve real liberation in the real world and by employing. real means, that slavery cannot be abolished without the steam¬engine and the mule and spinning-jenny, serfdom cannot be abolished without improved agriculture, and that, in general, people cannot be liberated as long as they are unable to obtain food and drink, housing and clothing in adequate quality and quantity. ""Liberation"" is a historical and not a mental act, and it is brought about by historical conditions, the  of industry, commerce, culture, the  * * * 5  \xa0\xa0\xa0In Germany,6a country where only a trivial historical development is taking place, these mental developments, these glorified and ineffective trivialities, naturally serve as a substitute for the lack of historical development, and they take root and have to be combated. But this fight is of local importance.7  \xa0\xa0\xa0* * * 8in reality and for the practical materialist, i.e., the communist, it is a question of revolutionising the existing world, of practically attacking and changing existing things . When occasionally we find such views with Feuerbach, they are never more than isolated surmises and have much too little influence on his general outlook to be considered here as anything else than embryos capable of development. Feuerbach\'s ""conception"" of the sensuous world is confined on the one hand to mere contemplation of it, and on the other to mere feeling; he says ""Man"" instead of ""real historical man."" ""Man"" is really ""the German."" In the first case, the contemplation of the sensuous world, he necessarily lights on things whichcontradict his consciousness and feeling, which disturb the harmony he presupposes, the harmony of all parts of the sensuous world and especially of man and nature.9 To remove this disturbance, he must take refuge in a double perception, a profane one which only perceives the ""flatly obvious"" and a higher, philosophical, one which perceives the ""true essence"" of things. He does not see how the sensuous world around him is, not a thing given direct from all eternity, remaining ever the same, but the product of industry and of the state of society; and, indeed, in the sense that it is an historical product, the result of the activity of a whole succession of generations, each standing on the shoulders of the preceding one, developing its industry and its intercourse, modifying its social system according to the changed needs. Even the objects of the simplest ""sensuous certainty"" are only given him through social development, industry and commercial intercourse. The cherry-tree, like almost all fruit-trees, was, as is well known, only a few centuries ago transplanted by commerce into our zone, and therefore only by this action of a definite society in a definite age it has become ""sensuous certainty"" for Feuerbach.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Incidentally, when we conceive things thus, as they really are and happened, every profound philosophical problem is resolved, as will be seen even more clearly later, quite simply into an empirical fact. For instance, the important question of the relation of man to nature (Bruno goes so far as to speak of ""the antitheses in nature and history"" (p. 110), as though these were two separate ""things"" and man did not always have before him an historical nature and a natural history) out of which all the ""unfathomably lofty works"" on ""substance"" and ""self-consciousness"" were born, crumbles of itself when we understand that the celebrated ""unity of man with nature"" has always existed in industry and has existed in varying forms in every epoch according to the lesser or greater development of industry, just like the ""struggle"" of man with nature, right up to the development of his productive powers on a corresponding basis. Industry and commerce, production and the exchange of the necessities of life, themselves determine distribution, the structure of the different social classes and are, in turn, determined by it as to the mode in which they are carried on; and so it happens that in Manchester, for instance, Feuerbach sees only factories and machines, where a hundred years ago only spinning-wheels and weaving-looms were to be seen, or in the Campagna of Rome he finds only pasture lands and swamps, where in the time of Augustus he would have found nothing but the vineyards and villas of Roman capitalists. Feuerbach speaks in particular of the perception of natural science; he mentions secrets which are disclosed only to the eye of the physicist and chemist; but where would natural science be without industry and commerce? Even this ""pure"" natural science is provided with an aim, as with its material, only through trade and industry, through the sensuous activity of men. So much is this activity, this unceasing sensuous labour and creation, this production, the basis of the whole sensuous world as it now exists, that, were it interrupted only for a year, Feuerbach would not only find an enormous change in the natural world, but would very soon find that the whole world of men and his own perceptive faculty, nay his own existence, were missing. Of course, in all this the priority of external nature remains unassailed, and all this has no application to the original men produced by generatio aequivoca; 1 but this differentiation has meaning only insofar as man is considered to be distinct from n ature. For that matter, nature, the nature that preceded human history, is not by any means the nature in which Feuerbach lives, it is nature which today no longer exists anywhere (except perhaps on a few Australian coral-islands of recent origin) and which, therefore, does not exist for Feuerbach.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Certainly Feuerbach has a great advantage over the ""pure"" materialists in that he realises how man too is an ""object of the senses."" But apart from the fact that he only conceives him as an ""object of the senses,"" not as ""sensuous activity,"" because he still remains in the realm of theory and conceives of men not in their given social connection, not under their existing conditions of life, which have made them what they are, he never arrives at the really existing active men, but stops at the abstraction ""man,"" and gets no further than recognising ""the true, individual, corporeal man"" emotionally, i.e., he knows no other ""human relationships"" ""of man to man"" than love and friendship, and even then idealised. He gives no criticism of the present conditions of life. Thus he never manages to conceive the sensuous world as the total living sensuous activity of the individuals composing it; and therefore when, for example, he sees instead of healthy men a crowd of scrofulous, overworked and consumptive starvelings, he is compelled to take refuge in the ""higher perception"" and in the ideal ""compensation in the species,"" and thus to relapse into idealism at the very p oint where the communist materialist sees the necessity, and at the same time the condition, of a transformation both of industry and of the social structure. \xa0\xa0\xa0As far as Feuerbach is a materialist he does not deal with history, and as far as he considers history he is not a materialist. With him materialism and history diverge completely, a fact which inciden¬tally is already obvious from what has been said.  \xa0\xa0\xa0History is nothing but the succession of the separate generations, each of which exploits the materials, the capital funds, the productive forces handed down to it by all preceding generations, and thus, on the one hand, continues the traditional activity in completely changed circumstances and, on the other, modifies the old circumstances with a completely changed activity. This can be speculatively distorted so that later history is made the goal of earlier history, e.g., the goal ascribed to the discovery of America is to further the eruption of the French Revolution. Thereby history receives its own special aims and becomes ""a person ranking with other persons"" (to wit: ""Self-Consciousness, Criticism, the Unique,"" etc.), while what is designated with the words ""destiny,"" ""goal,"" ""germ,"" or ""ideal"" of earlier history is nothing more than an abstraction formed from later history, from the active influence which earlier history exercises on later history.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The further the separate spheres, which act on one another, extend in the course of this development, the more the original isolation of the separate nationalities is destroyed by the developed mode of production and intercourse and the division of labour between various nations naturally brought forth by these, the more history becomes world history. Thus, for instance, if in England a machine is invented, which deprives countless workers of bread in India and China, and overturns the whole form of existence of these empires, this invention becomes a world-historical fact. Or again, take the case of sugar and coffee which have proved their world-historical importance in the nineteenth century by the fact that the lack of these products, occasioned by the Napoleonic Continental System, caused the Germans to rise against Napoleon, and thus became the real basis of the glorious ""Vars of Liberation of 1813. From this it follows that this transformation of history into world history is not indeed a mere abstract act on the part of the ""self-consciousness,"" the world spirit, or of any other metaphysical spectre, but a quite material, empirically verifiable act, an act the proof of which every individual furnishes as he comes and goes, eats, drinks and clothes himself .  \xa0\xa0\xa0The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas: i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectualforce. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas; hence of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, the ideas of its dominance. The individuals composing the ruling class possess among other things consciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they rule as a class and determine the extent and compass of an epoch, it is self-evident that they do this in its whole range, hence among other things rule also as thinkers, as producers of ideas, and regulate the production and distribution of the ideas of their age: thus their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch. For instance, in an age and in a country where royal power, aristocracy and bourgeoisie are contending for mastery and where, therefore, mastery is shared, the doctrine of the separation of powers proves to be the dominant idea and is expressed as an ""eternal law.""  \xa0\xa0\xa0The division of labour, which we have already seen above as one of the chief forces of history up till now, manifests itself also in the ruling class as the division of mental and material labour, so that inside this class one part appears as the thinkers of the class (its active, conceptive ideologists, who make the perfecting of the illusion of the class about itself their chief source of livelihood), while the others\' attitude to these ideas and illusions is more passive and receptive, because they are in reality the active members of this class and have less time to make up illusions and ideas about themselves. Within this class this cleavage can even develop into a certain opposition and hostility between the two parts, which, how¬ever, in the case of a practical collision, in which the class itself is endangered, automatically comes to nothing, in which case there also vanishes the semblance that the ruling ideas were not the ideas of the ruling class and had a power distinct from the power of this class. The existence of revolutionary ideas in a particular period pre¬supposes the existence of a revolutionary class; about the premises for the latter sufficient has already been said above.  \xa0\xa0\xa0If now in considering the course of history we detach the ideas of the ruling class from the ruling class itself and attribute to therp an independent existence, if we confine ourselves to saying that these or those ideas were dominant at a given time, without bothering ourselves about the conditions of production and the producers of these ideas, if we thus ignore the individuals and world conditions which are the source of the ideas, we can say, for instance, that during the time that the aristocracy was dominant, the concepts honour, loyalty, etc., were dominant, during the dominance of the bourgeoisie the concepts freedom, equality, etc. The ruling class itself on the whole imagines this to be so. This conception of history, which is common to all historians, particularly since the eighteenth century, will necessarily come up against the phenomenon that increasingly abstract ideas hold sway, i.e., ideas whichincreasingly take on the form of universality. For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of univer¬sality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones. The class making a revolution appears from the very start, if only because it is opposed to a class, not as a class but as the representative of the whole of society; it appears as thewhole mass of society confronting the one ruling class.2 It can do this because, to start with, its interest really is more connected with the common interest of all other non-ruling classes, because under the pressure of hitherto existing conditions its interest has not yet been able to develop as the particular interest of a particular class. Its victory, therefore, benefits also many individuals of the other classes which are not winning a dominant position, but only insofar as it now puts these individuals in a position to raise themselves into the ruling class. When the French bourgeoisie overthrew the power of the aristocracy, it thereby made it possible for many proletarians to raise themselves above the proletariat, but only insofar as they became bourgeois. Every new class, therefore, achieves its hegemony only on a broader basis than that of the class ruling previously, whereas the opposition of the non-ruling class against the new ruling class later develops all the more sharply and profoundly. Both these things determine the fact that the struggle to be waged against this new ruling class, in its turn, aims at a more decided and radical negation of the previous conditions of society than could all previous classes which sought to rule.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This whole semblance, that the rule of a certain class is only the rule of certain ideas, comes to a natural end, of course, as soon as class rule in general ceases to be the form in which society is organised, that is to say, as soon as it is no longer necessary to represent a particular interest as general or the ""general interest"" as ruling.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Once the ruling ideas have been separated from the ruling individuals and, above all, from the relationships which result from a given stage of the mode of production, and in this way the conclusion has been reached that history is always under the sway of ideas, it is very easy to abstract from these various ideas "" the idea,"" the notion, etc., as the dominant force in history, and thus to understand all these separate ideas and concepts as ""forms of self-determination"" on the part of the concept developing in history. Itfollows then naturally, too, that all the relationships of men can be derived from the concept of man, man as conceived, the essence of man, Man. This has been done by the speculative philosophers. Hegel himself confesses at the end of the Geschichtsphilosophiethat he ""has considered the progress of the concept only"" and has represented in history the ""true theodicy."" Now one can go back again to the producers of the ""concept,"" to the theorists, ideologists and philosophers, and one comes then to"" the conclusion that the philosophers, the thinkers as such, have at all times been dominant in history : a conclusion, as we see, already expressed by Hegel. The whole trick of proving the hegemony of the spirit in history ( hierarchy Stirner calls it) is thus confined to the following three efforts.  \xa0\xa0\xa0No. 1. One must separate the ideas of those ruling for empirical reasons, under empirical conditions and as empirical individuals, from these actual rulers, and thus recognise the rule of ideas or illusions in history.  \xa0\xa0\xa0No. 2. One must bring an order into this rule of ideas, prove a mystical connection among the successive ruling ideas, which is managed by understanding them as ""acts of self-determination on the part of the concept"" ( this is possible because by virtue of their empirical basis these ideas are really connected with one another and because, conceived asmere ideas, they become self-distinctions, distinctions made by thought) .  \xa0\xa0\xa0No. 3. To remove the mystical appearance of this ""self-determining concept"" it is changed into a person-""Self-Consciousness""¬or, to appear thoroughly materialistic, into a series of persons, who represent the ""concept"" in history, into the ""thinkers,"" the ""philosophers,"" the ideologists, who again are understood as the manufacturers of history, as the ""council of guardians,"" as the rulers.3Thus the whole body of materialistic elements has been removed from history and now full rein can be given to the speculative steed.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Whilst in ordinary life every shopkeeper is very well able to distinguish between what somebody professes to be and what he really is, our historians have not yet won even this trivial insight. They take every epoch at its word and believe that everything it says and imagines about itself is true.  \xa0\xa0\xa0This historical method which reigned in Germany and especially the reason why, must be understood from its connection with the illusion of ideologists in general, e.g., the illusions of the jurists, politicians (of the practical statesmen among them, too ), from the dogmatic dreamings and distortions of these fellows; this is explained perfectly easily from their practical position in life, their job, and the division of labour.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0  4  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa01. Intercourse and Productive Forces  \xa0\xa0\xa0The greatest division of material and mental labour is the separation of town and country. The antagonism between town and country begins with the transition from barbarism to civilisation, from tribe to State, from locality to nation, and runs through the whole history of civilisation to the present day ( the Anti-Corn Law League) .  \xa0\xa0\xa0The existence of the town implies, at the same time, the necessity of administration, police, taxes, etc., in short, of the municipality, and thus of politics in general. Here first became manifest the division of the population into two great classes, which is directly based on the division of labour and on the instruments of production. The town already is in actual fact the concentration of the population, of the instruments of production, of capital, of pleasures, of needs, while the country demonstrates just the opposite fact, isolation and separation. The antagonism between town and country can only exist within the framework of private property. It is the most crass expression of the subjection of the individual under the division of labour, under a definite activity forced upon him a subjection which makes one man into a restricted town¬animal, the other into a restricted country-animal, and daily creates anew the conflict between their interests. Labour is here again the chief thing, power over individuals, and as long as the latter exists, private property must exist. The abolition of the antagonism between town and country is one of the first conditions of communal life, a condition which again depends on a mass of material premises and which cannot be fulfilled by the mere will, as anyone can see at the first glance. (These conditions have still to be enumerated.) The separation of town and country can also be understood as the separation of capital and landed property, as the beginning of the existence and development of capital independent of landed property-the beginning of property having its basis only in labour and exchange.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In the towns which, in the Middle Ages, did not derive ready¬made from an earlier period but were formed anew by the serfs who had become free, each man\'s own particular labour was his only property apart from the small capital he brought with him, consisting almost solely of the most necessary tools of his craft. The competition of serfs constantly escaping into the town, the constant war of the country against the towns and thus the necessity of an organised municipal military force, the bond of common ownership in a particular kind of labour, the necessity of common buildings for sale of their wares at a time when craftsmen were also traders, and the consequent exclusion of the unauthorised from these buildings, the conflict among the interests of the various crafts, the necessity of protecting their laboriously acquired skill, and the feudal organisation of the whole of the country: these were the causes of the union of the workers of each craft in guilds. We have not at this point to go further into the manifold modifications of the guild-system, which arise through later historical developments. The flight of the serfs into the towns went on without interruption right through the Middle Ages. These serfs, persecuted by their lords in the country, came separately into the towns, where they found an organised community, against which they were powerless and in which they had to subject themselves to the station assigned to them by the demand for their labour and the interest of their organised urban competitors. These workers, entering separately, were never able to attain to any power, since, if their labour was of the guild type which had to be learned, the guild-masters bent them to their will and organised them according to their interest; or if their labour was not such as had to be learned, and therefore not of the guild type, they became day-labourers and never managed to organise, remaining an unorganised rabble. The need for day-labourers in the towns created the rabble.  \xa0\xa0\xa0These towns were true ""associations,"" called forth by the direct need, the care of providing for the protection of property, and of multiplying the means of production and defence of the separate members. The rabble of these towns was devoid of any power, composed as it was of individuals strange to one another who had entered separately, and who stood un organised over against an organised power, armed for war, and jealously watching over them. The journeymen and apprentices were organised in each craft as it best suited the interest of the masters. The patriarchal relationship existing between them and their masters gave the latter a double power-on the one hand because of their influence on the whole life of the journeymen, and on the other because, for the journeymen who worked with the same master, it was a real bond which held them together against the journeymen of other masters and separated them from these. And finally, the journeymen were bound to the existing order by their simple interest in becoming masters themselves. While, therefore, the rabble at least carried out revolts against the whole municipal order, revolts which remained completely ineffective because of their powerlessness, the journeymen never got further than small acts of insubordination within sepa-rate guilds, such as belong to the very nature of the guild system. The great risings of the Middle Ages all radiated from the country, but equally remained totally ineffective because of the isolation and consequent crudity of the peasants.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In the towns, the division of labour between the individual guilds was as yet  and, in the guilds themselves, not at all developed between the individual workers. Every workman had to be versed in a whole round of tasks, had to be able to make everything that was to be made with his tools. The limited commerce and the scanty communication between the individual towns, the lack of population and the narrow needs did not allow of a higher division of labour, and therefore every man who wished to become a master had to be proficient in the whole of his craft. Thus there is found with medieval craftsmen an interest in their special work and in proficiency in it, which was capable of rising to a narrow artistic sense. For this very reason, however, every medieval craftsman was completely absorbed in his work, to which he had a contented, slavish relationship, and to which he was subjected to a far greater extent than the modern worker, whose work is a matter of indifference to him.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Capital in these towns was a naturally derived capital, consisting of a house, the tools of the craft, and the natural, hereditary customers; and not being realisable, on account of the backwardness of commerce and the lack of circulation, it descended from father to son. Unlike modern capital, which can be assessed in money and which may be indifferently invested in this thing or that, this capital was directly connected with the particular work of the owner, inseparable from it and to this extent estate capital.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The next extension of the division of labour was the separation of production and commerce, the formation of a special class of merchants; a separation which, in the towns bequeathed by a former period, had been handed down ( among other things with the Jews ) and which very soon appeared in the newly formed ones. With this there was given the possibility of commercial communications transcending the immediate neighbourhood, a possibility, the realisation of which depended on the existing means of communication, the state of public safety in the countryside, which was determined by political conditions ( during the whole of the Middle Ages, as is well known, the merchants travelled in armed caravans ), and on the cruder or more advanced needs ( determined by the stage of culture attained) of the region accessible to intercourse.  \xa0\xa0\xa0With commerce the prerogative of a particular class, with the extension of trade through the merchants beyond the immediate surroundings of the town, there immediately appears a reciprocal action between production and commerce. The towns enter intorelations with one another, new tools are brought from one town into the other, and the separation between production and commerce soon calls forth a new division of production between the individual towns, each of which is soon exploiting a predominant branch of industry. The local restrictions of earlier times begin gradually to be broken down.  \xa0\xa0\xa0In the Middle Ages the citizens in each town were compelled to unite against the landed nobility to save their skins. The extension of trade, the establishment of communications, led the separate towns to get to know other towns, which had asserted the same interests in the struggle with the same antagonist. Out of the many local corporations of burghers there arose only gradually the burgher class. The conditions of life of the individual burghers became, on account of their contradiction to the existing relationships and of the mode of labour determined by these, conditions which were common to them all and independent of each individual. The burghers had created the conditions insofar as they had torn themselves free from feudal ties, and were created by them insofar as they were determined by their antagonism to the feudal system which they found in existence. When the individual towns began to enter into associations, these common conditions developed into class conditions. The same conditions, the same contradiction, the same interests necessarily called forth on the whole similar customs everywhere. The bourgeoisie itself, with its conditions, develops only gradually, splits according to the division of labour into various fractions and finally absorbs all propertied classes it finds in existence5( while it develops the majority of the earlier propertyless and a part of the hitherto propertied classes into a new class, the proletariat) in the measure to which all property found in existence is transformed into industrial or commercial capital. The separate individuals form a class only insofar as they have to carry on a common battle against another class; otherwise they are on hostile terms with each other as competitors. On the other hand, the class in its turn achieves an independent existence  overagainst the individuals, so that the latter find their conditions of existence predestined, and hence have their position in life and their personal development assigned to them by their class, become subsumed under it. This is the same phenomenon as thlre subjection of the separate individuals to the division of labour and can only be removed by the abolition of private property and of labour itself. We have already indicated several times how this subsuming of individuals under the class brings with it their subjection to all kinds of ideas, etc.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 It depends purely on the extension of commerce whether the productive forces achieved in a locality, especially inventions, are lost for later development or not. As long as there exists no commerce transcending the immediate neighborhood, every invention must be made separately in each locality, and mere chances such as irruptions of barbaric peoples, even ordinary wars, are sufficient to cause a country with advanced productive forces and needs to have to start right over again from the beginning. In primitive history every invention had to be made daily anew and in each locality independently. How little highly developed productive forces are safe from complete destruction, given even a relatively very extensive commerce, is proved by the Phoenicians,6 whose inventions were for the most part lost for a long time to come through the ousting of this nation from commerce, its conquest by Alexander and its consequent decline. Likewise, for instance, glass-painting in the Middle Ages. Only when commerce has become world commerce and has as its basis large-scale industry, when all nations are drawn into the competitive struggle, is the permanence of the acquired productive forces assured.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The immediate consequence of the division of labour between the various towns was the rise of manufactures, branches of produc¬tion which had outgrown the guild-system. Manufactures first flour¬ished, in Italy and later in Flanders, under the historical premise of commerce with foreign nations. In other countries, England and France for example, manufactures were at first confined to the home market. Besides the premises already mentioned manufactures depend on an already advanced concentration of population, particularly in the countryside, and of capital, which began to accumulate in the hands of individuals, partly in the guilds in spite of the guild regulations, partly among the merchants. \xa0\xa0\xa0That labour which from the first presupposed a machine, even of the crudest sort, soon showed itself the most capable of development. Weaving, earlier carried on in the country by the peasants as a secondary occupation to procure their clothing, was the first labour to receive an impetus and a further development through the extension of commerce. Weaving was the first and remained the principal manufacture. The rising demand for clothing materials, consequent on the growth of population, the growing accumulation and mobilisation of natural capital through accelerated circulation, the demand for luxuries called forth by the latter and favoured generally by the gradual extension of commerce, gave weaving a quantitative and qualitative stimulus, which wrenched it out of the form of production hitherto existing. Alongside the peasants weaving for their own use, whocontinued, and still continue, with this sort of work, there emerged a new class of weavers in the towns, whose fabrics were destined for the whole home market and usually for foreign markets too:  \xa0\xa0\xa0Weaving, an occupation demanding in most cases little skill and soon splitting up into countless branches, by its whole nature resisted the trammels of the guild. Weaving was, therefore, carried on mostly in villages and market centres without guild organisation, which gradually became towns, and indeed the most flourishing towns in each land.  \xa0\xa0\xa0With guild-free manufacture, property relations also quickly changed. The first advance beyond naturally derived estate capital was provided by the rise of merchants whose capital was from the beginning movable, capital in the modern sense as far as one can speak of it, given the circumstances of those times. The second advance came with manufacture, which again made mobile a mass of natural capital, and altogether increased the mass of movable capital as against that of natural capital. \xa0\xa0\xa0At the same time, manufacture became a refuge of the peasants from the guilds which excluded them or paid them badly, just as earlier the guild-towns had  as a refuge for the peasants from  .  \xa0\xa0\xa0Simultaneously with the beginning of manufactures there was a period of vagabondage caused by the abolition of the feudal bodies of retainers, the disbanding of the swollen armies which had flocked to serve the kings against their vassals, the improvement of agriculture, and the transformation of great strips of tillage into pasture land. From this alone it is clear how this vagabondage is strictly connected with the disintergration of the feudal system. As early as the thirteenth century we find isolated epochs of this kind, but only at the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth does this vagabondage make a general and permanent appearance. These vagabonds, who were so numerous that, for instance, Henry VIlI of England had 72,000 of them hanged, were only prevailed upon to work with the greatest difficulty and through the most extreme necessity, and then only after long resistance. The rapid rise of manufactures, particularly in England, absorbed them gradually.  \xa0\xa0\xa0With the advent of manufactures, the various nations entered into a competitive relationship, the struggle for trade, which was fought out in wars, protective duties and prohibitions, whereas earlier the nations, insofar as they were connected at all, had carried on an inoffensive exchange with each other. Trade had from now on a political significance.  \xa0\xa0\xa0With the advent of manufacture the relationship between worker and employer changed. In the guilds the patriarchal relationship between journeyman and master continued to exist; in manufacture its place was taken by the monetary relation between worker aad capitalist-a relationship which in the countryside and in small towns retained a patriarchal tinge, but in the larger, the real manufacturing towns, quite early lost almost all patriarchal complexion. \xa0\xa0\xa0Manufacture and the movement of production in general received an enormous impetus through the extension of commerce which came with the discovery of America and the sea-route to the East Indies. The new products imported thence, particularly the masses of gold and silver which came into circulation and totally changed the position of the classes towards one another, dealing a hard blow to feudal landed property and to the workers; the expeditions of adventurers, colonisation; and above all the extension of markets into a world market, which had now become possible and was daily becoming more and more a fact, called forth a new phase of historical development, into which in general we cannot here enter further. Through the colonisation of the newly discovered countries the commercial struggle of the nations amongst one another was given new fuel and accordingly greater extension and animosity.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The expansion of trade and manufacture accelerated the accumulation of movable capital, while in the guilds, which were not stimulated to extend their production, natural capital remained stationary or even declined. Trade and manufacture created the big bourgeoisie; in the guilds was concentrated the petty bourgeoisie, which no longer was dominant in the towns as formerly, but had to bow to the might of the great merchants and manufacturers.7Hence the decline of the guilds, as soon as they came into contact with manufacture. \xa0\xa0\xa0The intercourse of nations took on, in the epoch of which we have been speaking, two different forms. At first the small quantity of gold and silver in circulation involved the ban on the export of these metals; and industry, for the most part imported from a broad and made necessary by the need for employing the growing urban population, could not do without those privileges which could be granted not only, of course, against home competition, but chiefly against foreign. The local guild privilege was in these original prohibitions extended over the whole nation. Customs duties originated from the tributes which the feudal lords exacted as protective levies against robbery from merchants passing through their territories; tributes later imposed likewise by the towns, and which, with therise of the modem states, were the Treasury\'s most obvious means of raising money.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The appearance of American gold and silver on the European markets, the gradual development of industry, the rapid expansion of trade and the consequent rise of the non-guild bourgeoisie and of money, gave these measures another significance. The State, which was daily less and less able to do without money, now retained the ban on the export of gold and silver out of fiscal considerations; the bourgeois, for whom these masses of money which were hurled on to the market became the chief object of speculative buying, were thoroughly content with this; privileges established earlier became a source of income for the government and were sold for money; in the customs legislation there appeared the export duty, which, since it only  a hindrance in the way of industry, had a purely fiscal aim.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The second period began in the middle of the seventeenth century and lasted almost to the end of the eighteenth. Commerce and navigation had expanded more rapidly than manufacture, which played a secondary role; the colonies were becoming considerable consumers; and after long struggles the separate nations shared out the opening world market among themselves. This period begins with the Navigation Laws and colonial monopolies. The competition of the nations among themselves was excluded as far as possible by tariffs, prohibitions and treaties; and in the last resort the competitive struggle was carried on and decided by wars (especially naval wars). The mightiest maritime nation, the English, retained preponderance in trade and manufacture. Here, already, we find concentration in one country.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Manufacture was all the time sheltered by protective duties in the home market, by monopolies in the colonial market, and abroad as much as possible by differential duties . The working-up of home-produced material was encouraged ( wool and linen in England, silk in France ), the export of home-produced raw material forbidden (wool in England), and the  of imported material neglected or suppressed (cotton in England ). The nation dominant in sea trade and colonial power naturally secured for itself also the greatest quantitative and qualitative expansion of manufacture. Manufacture could not be carried on without protection , since, if the slightest change takes place inother countries, it can lose its market and be ruined; under reasonably favourable conditions it may easily be introduced into a country, but for this very reason can easily be destroyed. At the same time through the mode in which it is carried on, particularly in the eighteenth century, in the countryside, it is to such an extent inter-woven with the vital relationships of a great mass of individuals, that no country dare jeopardise its existence by permitting free competition. Insofar as it manages to export, it therefore depends entirely on the extension or restriction of commerce, and exercises a relatively very small reaction  . Hence its secondary  and the influence of  in the eighteenth century. It was the merchants and especially the shippers who more than anybody else pressed for State protection and monopolies; the manufacturers also demanded and indeed received protection, but all the time were inferior in political importance to the merchants. The commercial towns, particularly the maritime towns, became to some extent civilised and acquired the outlook of the big bourgeoisie, but in the factory towns an extreme petty bourgeois outlook persisted. Cf. Aiken, etc. The eighteenth centurywas the century of trade. Pinto says this expressly: ""Le commerce fait la marotte du siècle"";8 and: ""Depuis quelque temps il n\'est plus question que de commerce, de navigation et de marine. ""9  \xa0\xa0\xa0This period is also characterised by the cessation of the bans on the export of gold and silver and the beginning of the trade in money; by banks, national debts, paper money; by speculation in stocks and shares and stockjobbing in all articles; by the development of finance in general. Again capital lost a great part of the natural character which had still clung to it.  \xa0\xa0\xa0The concentration of trade and manufacture in one country, England, developing irresistibly in the seventeenth century, gradually created for this country a relative world market, and thus a demand for the manufactured products of this country, which could no longer be met by the industrial productive forces hitherto existing. This deinand, outgrowing the productive forces, was the motive power which, by producing big industry the application of elemental forces to industrial ends, machinery and the most complex division of labour called into existence the third period of private ownership since the Middle Ages. There already existed in England the other pre-conditions of this new phase: freedom of competition inside the nation, the development of theoretical mechanics, etc. ( Indeed, the science of mechanics perfected by Newton was altogether the most popular science in France and England in the eighteenth century. )( Free competition inside the nation itself had everywhere to be conquered by a revolution-1640 and 1688 in England, 1789 in France. ) Competition soon compelled every country that wished to retain its historical role to protect its manufactures by renewed customs regulations ( the old duties were no longer any good against big industry) and soon after to introduce big industry under protective duties. Big industry universalised competition in spite of these protective measures ( it is practical free trade; the protective duty is only a palliative, a measure of defence within free trade ), established means of communication and the modern world market, subordinated trade to itself, transformed all capital into industrial capital, and thus produced the rapid circulation ( development of the financial system ) and the centralisation of capital. By universal competition it forced all individuals to strain their energy to the utmost. It destroyed as far as possible ideology, religion, morality, etc., and where it could not do this, made them into a palpable lie. It produced world history for the first time, insofar as it made all civilised nations and every individual member of them dependent for the satisfaction of their wants on the whole world, thus destroying the former natural exclusiveness of separate nations. It made natural science subservient to capital and took from the division of labour the last semblance of its natural character. It destroyed natural growth in general, as far as this is possible while labour exists, and resolved all natural relationships into money relationships. In the place of naturally grown towns it created the modern, large industrial cities which have sprung up overnight. Wherever it penetrated, it destroyed the crafts and all earlier stages of industry. It completed the victory of the commercial town over the countryside.  was the automatic system.  produced a mass of productive forces, for which private  became just as much a fetter as the guild had been for manufacture and the small, rural workshop for the developing craft. These productive forces received under the system of private property a one¬sided development only, and became for the majority destructive forces; moreover, a great multitude of such forces could find no application at all within this system. Generally speaking, big industry created everywhere the same relations between the classes of society, and thus destroyed the peculiar individuality of the various nationalities. And finally, while the bourgeoisie of each nation still retained separate national interests, big industry created a class, which in all nations has the same interest and with which nationality is already dead; a class which is really rid of all the old worldand at the same time stands pitted against it. Big industry makes for the worker not only the relation to the capitalist, but labouritself, unbearable.  \xa0\xa0\xa0It is evident that big industry does not reach the same level ofdevelopment in all districts of a country. This does not, however, retard the class movement of the proletariat, because the proletarians created by big industry assume leadership of this movement and carry the whole mass along with them, and because the workers excluded from big industry are placed by it in a still worse situation than the workers in big industry itself. The countries in which big industry is developed act in a similar manner upon the more or less non-industrial countries, insofar as the latter are swept by universal commerce into the universal competitive struggle.l  \xa0\xa0\xa0These different forms are just so many forms of the organisation of labour, and hence of property. In each period a unification of the existing - productive forces takes place, insofar as this has been rendered necessary by needs.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 2. The Relation of State and Law to Property  \xa0\xa0\xa0The first form of property, in the ancient world as in the Middle Ages, is tribal property, determined with the Romans chiefly by war, with the Germans by the rearing of cattle. In the case of the ancient peoples, since several tribes live together in one town, thetribal property appears as State property, and the right of the individual to it as mere ‘’possession’’ which, however, like tribal property as a whole, is confined to landed property only. Real private property began with the ancienfs, as with modern nationll, with movable property.(Slavery and community) ( dominium ex jure Quiritum2 ). In the case of the nations which grew out of the Middle Ages, tribal property evolved through various stages-feudal landed property, corporative movable property, capital invested in manufacture-to modern capital, determined by big industry and universal competition, i.e., pure private property, which has cast off all semblance of a communal institution and has shut out the State from any influence on the development of property. To thismodern private property corresponds the modern State, which, purchased gradually by the owners of property by means of taxation, has fallen entirely into their hands through the national debt, and its existence has become wholly dependent on the commercial credit which the owners of property, the bourgeois, extend to it, as reflected in the rise and fall of State funds on the stock exchange. By the mere fact that it is a class and no longer an estate, the bour Geoisie is forced to organize itself no longer locally, but nationally, and to give a general form to its mean average interest. Through the emancipation of private property from the community, the State has become a separate entity, beside and outside Civil society; but it is nothing more than the form of organisation which  the bourgeois necessarily adopt both for internal and external purposes, forthe mutual guarantee of their property and interests. The independence of the State is only found nowadays  in those countries where the estates have not yet completely developed into classes, where the estates, done away with in more advanced countries, still have a part to play, and where there exists a mixture; countries, that is to say, in which no one section of the population can achieve dominance over the others. This is the case particularly in Germany. The most perfect example of the modern State is North America. The modern French, English and American writers all express the opinion that the State exists only for the sake of private property, so that this fact has penetrated into the consciousness of the normal man.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Since the State is the form in which the individuals of a ruling class assert their common interests, and in which the whole civil society of an epoch is epitomised, it follows that the State mediates in the formation of all common institutions and that the institutions receive a political form. Hence the illusion that law is based on the will, and indeed on the will divorced from its real basis on free will. Similarly, justice is in its turn reduced to the actual laws.  \xa0\xa0\xa0Civil law develops simultaneously with private property out of the disintegration of the natural community . With the Romans the development of private property and civil law had no further\' industrial and commercial consequences, because their whole mode of production did not alter.3 With modern peoples, where the feudal community was disintegrated by industry and trade, there began with the rise of private property and civil law a new phase, which was capable of  further development. The very first town which carried on an extensive maritime trade in the Middle Ages, Amalfi, also developed maritime law. As soon as industry and trade developed private property further, first in Italy and later in other countries, the highly developed Roman civil law was immediately adopted again and raised to authority. When later the bourgeoisie had acquired so much power that the princes took up its interests in order to overthrow the feudal nobility by means of the bourgeoisie, there began in all countries-in France in the sixteenth century-the real development of law, which in all countries except Eng-land proceeded on the basis of the Roman Codex. In England, too, Roman legal principles had to be introduced to further the development of civil law (especially in the case of movable property). (It must not be forgotten that law has just as little an independent cc history as religion.)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In civil law the existing property relationships are declared to be the result of the general will. The jus utendi et abutendi4 itself asserts on the one hand the fact that private property has become entirely independent of the community, and on the other the illu¬sion that private property itself is based solely on the private will, the arbitrary disposal of the thing. In practice, the abuti5 has very definite economic limitations for the owner of private property, if he does not wish to see his property and hence his jus abutendi pass into other hands, since actually the thing, considered merely with reference to his will, is not a thing at all, but only becomes a thing, true property in intercourse, and independently of the law (a relationship, which the philosophers call an idea 5 ). This juridical illusion, which reduces law to the mere will, necessarily leads, in the further development of property relationships, to the position that a man may have a legal title to a thing without really having the thing. If, for instance, the income from a piece of land is lost owing to competition, then the proprietor has certainly his legal title to it along with the jus utendi et abutendi. But he can do nothing with it: he owns nothing as a landed proprietor if in addi¬tion he has not enough capital to cultivate his ground. This illusion of the jurists also explains the fact that for them, as for every code, it is altogether fortuitous that individuals enter into relationships among themselves (e.g., contracts); it explains why they consider that these relationships  be entered into or not at will, and that their content rests purely on the individual  will of the contracting parties.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Whenever, through the development of industry and commerce, new forms of intercourse have been evolved (e.g., ensurance companies, etc.), the law has always been compelled to admit them among the modes of acquiring property.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0   \xa0 \xa0 \xa0* * * 7 From the first, there follows the premise of a highly developed division of labour and an extensive commerce; from the second, the locality. In the first case the individuals must be brought together, in the second they find themselves alongside the given instrument of production as instruments of production themselves. Here, therefore, arises the difference between natural instruments of production and those created by civilisation. The field (water, etc.) can be regarded as a natural instrument of production. In the first case, that of the natural instrument of production, individuals are subservient to nature; in the second, to a product of labour. In the first case, therefore, property (landed property) appears as direct natural domination in the second, as domination of labour, particularly of accumulated labour, capital. The first case presupposes that the individuals are united by some bond: family, tribe, the land itself, etc.; the second that they are independent of one another and are only held together by exchange. In the first case, what is involved is chiefly an exchange between men and nature in which the labour of the former is exchanged for the products of the latter; in the second, it is predominantly an exchange of men among themselves. In the first case, average, human commonsense is adequate-physical activity is as yet not separated from mental activity; in the second, the division between physical and mental labour must already be practically completed. In the first case, the domination of the proprietor over the property less may be based on a personal relationship, on a kind of community; in the second, it must have taken on a material shape in a third party¬money. In the first case, small industry exists, but determined by the utilisation of the natural instrument of production and therefore without the distribution of labour among various individuals; in the second, industry exists only in and through the division of labour.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Our investigation hitherto started from the instruments of production, and it has already shown that private property was a necessity for certain industrial stages. In industrie extractive private property still coincides with labour; in small industry and all agriculture up till now property is the necessary consequence of the existing instruments of production; in big industry the contradiction between the instrument of production and private property appears for the first time and is the product of big industry; moreover, big industry must be highly developed to produce this contradiction. And thus only with big industry does the abolition of private property become possible.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0In big industry and competition the whole mass of conditions of existence, limitations, biases of individuals, are fused together into the two simplest forms : private property and labour. With money every form of intercourse, and intercourse itself, is considered for¬tuitous for the individuals. Thus money implies that all previous intercourse was only intercourse of individuals under particular conditions, not of individuals as individuals. These conditions are reduced to two: accumulated labour or private property, and actual labour. If both or one of these ceases, then intercourse comes to a standstill. The modern economists themselves, e.g., Sismondi, Cherbuliez, etc., oppose ""association of individuals"" to ""association of capital."" On the other hand, the individuals themselves are entirely subordinated to the division of labour and hence are brought into the most complete dependence on one another. Private property, insofar as within labour itself it is opposed to labour, evolves out of the necessity of accumulation, and has still, to begin with, rather the form of the communality; but in its further development it approaches more and more the modern form of private property. The division of labour implies from the outset the division of the conditions of labour, of tools and materials, and thus the splitting-up of accumulated capital among different owners, and thus, also, the division between capital and labour, and the different forms of property itself. The more the division of labour develops and accumulation grows, the sharper are the forms that this process of differentiation assumes. Labour itself can only exist on the premise of this fragmentation.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thus two facts are here revealed.8  First the productive forces appear as a world for themselves, quite independent of and divorced from the individuals, alongside the individuals: the reason for this is that the individuals, whose forces they are, exist split up and in opposition to one another, whilst, on the other hand, these forces are only real forces in the intercourse and association of these individuals. Thus, on the one hand, we have a totality of productive forces, which have, as it were, taken on a material form and are for the individuals no longer the forces of the individuals but of private property, and hence of the individuals only insofar as they are owners of private property themselves. Never, in any earlier period, have the productive forces taken on a form so indifferent to the intercourse of individuals as individuals, because the.ir inter¬course itself was formerly a restricted one. On the other hand, standing over against these productive forces, we have the majority of the individuals from whom these forces have been wrested away, and who, robbed thus of all real life-content, have become abstract individuals, but who are, however, only by this fact put into a position to enter into relation with one another as individuals.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The only connection which still links them with the productive forces and with their own existence-labour has lost all sem¬blance of self-activity and only sustains their life by stunting it. While in the earlier periods self-activity and the production of material life were separated, in that they devolved on different persons, and while, on account of the narrowness of the individuals themselves, the production of material life was considered as a subordinate mode of self-activity, they now diverge to such an extent that altogether material life appears as the end, and what produces this material life, labour ( which is now the only possible but, as we see, negative form of self-activity ), as the means.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thus things have now come to such a pass, that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces, not only to achieve self-activity, but, also, merely to safeguard their very existence. This appropriation is first determined by the object to be appropriated, the productive forces, which have been developed to a totality and which only exist within a universal intercourse. From this aspect alone, therefore, this appropriation must have a universal character corresponding to the productive forces and the intercourse. The appropriation of these forces is itself nothing more than the development of the individual capacities corresponding to the material instruments of production. The appropriation of a totality of instruments of production is, for this very reason, the development of a totality of capacities in the individuals themselves. This appropriation is further determined by the persons appropriating. Only the proletarians of the present day, who are completely shut off from all self-activity, are in a position to achieve a complete and no longer restricted self-activity, which consists in the appropriation of a totality of productive forces and in the thus postulated development of a totality of capacities. All earlier revolutionary appropriations were restricted; individuals, whose self-activity was restricted by a crude instrument of production and a limited intercourse, appropriated this crude instrument of production, and hence merely achieved a new state of limitation. Their instrument of production became their property, but they themselves remained subordinate to the division of labour and their own instrument of production. In all expropriations up to now, a mass of individuals remained subservient to a single instrument of production; in the appropriation by the proletarians, a mass of instruments of production must be made subject to each individual and property to all. Modern universal intercourse can be controlled by individuals, therefore, only when controlled by all.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0This appropriation is further determined by the manner in which it must be effected. It can only be effected through a union, which by the character of the proletariat itself can again only be a universal one, and through a revolution, in which, on the one hand, the power of the earlier mode of production and intercourse and social organisation is overthrown, and, on the other hand, there develops the universal character and the energy of the proletariat, without which the revolution cannot be accomplished; and in which, further, the proletariat rids itself of everything that still clings to it from its previous position in society.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural limitations. The transformation of labour into self-activity corresponds to the transformation of the earlier limited intercourse into the intercourse of individuals as such. With the appropriation of the total productive forces through united individuals, private property comes to an end. Whilst previously in history a particular condition always appeared as accidental, now the isolation of individuals and the particular private gain of each man have themselves become accidental.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The individuals, who a re no longer subject to the division of labour, have been conceived by the philosophers as an ideal, under the name ""Man."" They have conceived the whole process which we have outlined as the evolutionary process of ""Man,"" so that at every historical stage ""Man"" was substituted for the individuals and shown as the motive force of history. The whole process was thus conceived as a process of the self-estrangement of ""Man,"" and this was essentially due to the fact that the average individual of the later stage was always foisted on to the earlier stage, and the consciousness of a later age on to the individuals of an earlier. Through this inversion, which from the first is an abstract image of the actual conditions, it was possible to transform the whole of history into an evolutionary process of consciousness.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Finally, from the conception of history we have sketched we obtain these further conclusions: (1) In the development of productive forces there comes a stage  when productive forces and means of intercourse are brought into being, which, under the existing relationships, only cause mischief, and are no longer productive but destructive forces ( machinery and money); and connected with this a class is called forth, which has to bear all the burdens of society without enjoying its advantages, which, ousted from society, is forced into the most decided antagonism to all other classes; a class which forms the majority of all members of society, and from which emanates the consciousness of the necessity of a fundamental revolution, the communist consciousness, which may, of course, arise among the other classes too through the contemplation of the situation of this class. (2) The conditions under which definite productive forces can be applied, are the conditions of the rule C?f a definite class of society, whose social power, deriving from its property, has its practical-idealistic expression in each case in the form of the State; and, therefore, every revolutionary struggle is directed against a class, which till then has been in power.9 (3) In all revolutions up till now the mode of activity always remained unscathed and it was only a question of a different distribution of this activity, a new distribution of labour to other persons, whilst the communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity, does away with labour, and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes themselves, because it is carried through by the class which no longer counts as a class in society, is not recognised as a class, and is in itself the expression of the dissolution of all classes, nationalities, etc., within present society; and (4) Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and for the success of the cause itself, the alteration of men on a mass scale is necessary, an alteration which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in  any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 C. COMMUNISM. THE PRODUCTION OF THE FORM \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 OF INTERCOURSE  ITSELF  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Communism differs from all previous movements in that it over¬turns the basis of all earlier relations of production and intercourse, and for the first time consciously treats all natural premises as the creatures of hitherto existing men, strips them of their natural character and subjugates them to the power of the united individuals. Its organisation is, therefore, essentially economic, the material\' production of the conditions of this unity; it turns existing conditions into conditions of unity. The reality, which communism is creating, is precisely the true basis for rendering it impossible that anything should exist independently of individuals, in so far, as reality is only a product of the preceding intercourse of individuals themselves. Thus the communists in practice treat the conditions created up to now by production and intercourse as inorganic conditions, without, however, imagining that it was the plan or the destiny of previous generations to give them material, and without believing that these conditions were inorganic for the individuals creating them. The difference between the individual as a person and what is accidental to him is not a conceptual difference but a historical fact. This distinction has a different significance at different times-e.g., the estate as something accidental to the individual in the eighteenth century, the family more or less too. It is not a distinction that we have to make for each age, but one which each age makes itself from among the different elements which it finds in existence, and indeed not according to any theory, but compelled by material collisions in life. What appears accidental to the later age as opposed to the earlier-and this applies also to the elements handed down by an earlier age-is a form of intercourse which corresponded to a definite stage of development of the productive forces. The relation of the productive forces to the form of intercourse is the relation of the form of intercourse to the occupation or activity of the individuals. (The fundamental form of this activity is, of course, material, on which depend all other forms-mental, political, religious, etc. The various shaping of material life is, of course, in every case dependent on the needs which are already developed, and the production, as well as the satisfaction, of these needs is an historical process, which is not found in the case of a sheep or a dog. (Stirner\'s refractory principal argument adversus hominem), although sheep and dogs in their present form certainly, but malgre eux, are products of an historical process.) The conditions under which individuals have intercourse with each other, so long as the above-mentioned contradiction is absent, are conditions appertaining to their individuality, in no way external to them; conditions under which these definite individuals, living under definite relations, can alone produce their material life and what is connected with it, are thus the conditions of their self-activity and are produced by this self-activity.1 The definite condition under which they produce, thus corresponds, as long as the contradiction has not yet appeared, to the reality of their condi¬tioned nature, their one-sided existence, the one-sidedness of which only becomes evident when the contradiction enters on the scene and thus exists for the later individuals. Then this condition appears as an accidental fetter, and the consciousness that it is a fetter is imputed to the earlier age as well.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0These various conditions, which appear first as conditions of self-activity, later as fetters upon it, form in the whole evolution of history a coherent series of forms of intercourse, the coherence of which consists in this: in the place of an earlier form of inter¬course, which has become a fetter, a new one is put, corresponding to the more developed productive forces and, hence, to the advanced mode of the self-activity of individuals-a form which in its turn becomes a fetter and is then replaced by another. Since these conditions correspond at every stage to the simultaneous development of the productive forces, their history is at the same time the history of the evolving productive forces taken over by each new generation, and is, therefore, the history of the development of the forces of the individuals themselves.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Since this evolution takes place naturally, i.e., is not subordinated to a general plan of freely combined individuals, it proceeds from various localities, tribes, nations, branches of labour, etc., each of which to start with develops independently of the others and only gradually enters into relation with the others. Furthermore, it takes place only very slowly; the various stages and interests are never completely overcome, but only subordinated to the prevailing interest and trail along beside the latter for centuries afterwards. It follows from this that within a nation itself the individuals, even apart from their pecuniary circumstances, have quite different developments, and that an earlier interest, the peculiar form of intercourse of which has already been ousted by that belonging to a later interest, remains for a long time afterwards in possession of a traditional power in the illusory community ( State, law), which has won an existence independent of the individuals; a power which in the last resort can only be broken by a revolution. This explains why, with reference to individual points which allow of a more general summing-up, consciousness can sometimes appear further advanced than the contemporary empirical relationships, so that in the struggles of a latter epoch one can refer to earlier theoreticians as authorities.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0On the other hand, in countries which, like North America begin in an already advanced historical epoch, the development proceeds very rapidly. Such countries have no other natural premises than the individuals, who settled there and were led to do so because the forms of intercourse of the old countries did not correspond to their wants. Thus they begin with the most advanced individuals of the old countries, and, therefore, with the correspondingly most advanced form of intercourse, before this form of intercourse has been able to establish itself in the old countries.2 This is the case with all colonies, insofar as they are not mere military or trading stations. Carthage, the Greek colonies, and Iceland in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, provide examples of this. A similar relationship issues from conquest, when a form of intercourse which has evolved on another soil is brought over complete to the conquered country: whereas in its home it was still encumbered with interests and relationships left over from earlier periods, here it can and must be established completely and without hindrance, if only to assure the conquerors\' lasting power. (England and Naples after the Norman conquest, when they received the most perfect form of feudal organisation.)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Nothing is more common than the notion that in history up till now it has only been a question of taking. The barbarians take the Roman Empire, and this fact of taking is made to explain the transition from the old world to the feudal system. In this taking by barbarians, however, the question is, whether the nation which is conquered has evolved industrial productive forces, as is the case with modern peoples, or whether their productive forces are based for the most part merely on their association and on the community. Taking is further determined by the object taken. A banker\'s fortune, consisting of paper, cannot be taken at all, without the taker\'s submitting to the conditions of production and intercourse of the country taken. Similarly the total industrial capital of a modern industrial country, and finally, everywhere there is very soon an end to taking, and when there is nothing more to take, you have to set about producing. From this necessity of producing, which very soon asserts itself, it follows that the form of community adopted by the settling conquerors must correspond to the stage of development of the productive forces they find in existence; or, if this is not the case from the start, it must change according to the productive forces. By this, too, is explained the fact, which people profess to have noticed everywhere in the period following the migration of the peoples, namely, that the servant was master, and that the conquerors very soon took over language, culture and manners from the conquered. The feudal system was by no means brought complete from Germany, but had its origin, as far as the conquerors were concerned, in the martial organisation of the army during the actual conquest, and this only evolved after the conquest into the feudal system proper through the action of the productive forces found in the conquered countries. To what an extent this form was determined by the productive forces is shown by the abortive attempts to realise other forms derived from reminiscences of ancient Rome (Charlemagne, etc.).  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thus all collisions in history have their origin, according to our view, in the contradiction between the productive forces and the form of intercourse. Incidentally, to lead to collisions in a country, this contradiction need not necessarily have reached its extremelimit in this particular country. The competition with industrially more advanced countries, brought about by the expansion of international intercourse, is sufficient to produce a similar contradiction in countries with a backward industry (e.g., the latent proletariat in Germany brought into view by the competition of English indus¬try) .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0This contradiction between the productive forces and the form of intercourse, which, as we saw, has occurred several times in past history, without, however, endangering the basis, necessarily on each occasion burst out in a revolution, taking on at the same time various subsidiary forms, such as all-embracing collisions, collisions of various classes, contradiction of consciousness, battle of ideas, etc., political conflict, etc. From a narrow point of view one may isolate one of these subsidiary forms and consider it as the basis of these revolutions; and this is all the more easy as the individuals who started the revolutions had illusions about their own activity according to their degree of culture and the stage of historical development.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The transformation, through the division of labour, of personal powers (relationships ) into material powers, cannot be dispelled by dismissing the general idea of it from one\'s mind, but can only be abolished by the individuals again subjecting these material powers to themselves and abolishing the division of labour.3 This is not possible without the community. Only in community  individual the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; only in the community, therefore, is personal freedom possible. In the previous substitutes for the community, in the State, etc., personal freedom has existed only for the individuals who developed within the relationships of the ruling class, and only insofar as they were individuals of this class. The illusory community, in which individuals have up till now combined, always took on an independent existence in relation to them, and was at the same time, since it was the combination of one class over against another, not only a completely illusory community, but a new fetter as well. In the real community the individuals obtain their freedom in and through their association.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0It follows from all we have been saying up till now that the communal relationship into which the individuals of a class entered, and which was determined by their common interests over against a third party, was always a community to which these individuals belonged only as average individuals, only insofar as they lived within the conditions of existence of their class-a relationship in which they participated not as individuals but as members of a class. With the community of revolutionary proletarians, on the other hand, who take their conditions of existence and those of all members of society under their control, it is just the reverse; it is as individuals that the individuals participate in it. It is just this combination of individuals (assuming the advanced stage of modern productive forces, of course) which puts the conditions of the free development and movement of individuals under their control conditions which were previously abandoned to chance and had won an independent existence over against the separate individuals just because of their separation as individuals, and because of the necessity of their combination which had been determined by the division of labour, and through their separation had become a bond alien to them. Combination up till now (by no means an arbitrary one, such as is expounded for example in the Contrat social, but a necessary one) was an agreement upon these conditions, within which the individuals were free to enjoy the freaks of fortune (compare, e.g., the formation of the North American State and the South American republics). This right to the undisturbed enjoyment, within certain conditions, of fortuity and chance has up till now been called personal freedom. These conditions of existence are, of course, only the productive forces and forms of intercourse at any particular time.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0If from a philosophical point of view one considers this evolution of individuals in the common conditions of existence of estates and classes, which followed on one another, and in the accompanying general conceptions forced upon them, it is certainly very easy to imagine that in these individuals the species, or ""Man,"" has evolved, or that they evolved ""Man""-and in this way one can give history some hard clouts on the ear.4 One can conceive these various estates and classes to be specific terms of the general expression, subordinate varieties of the species, or evolutionary phases of  ""Man.""  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0This subsuming of individuals under definite classes cannot be abolished until a class has taken shape, which has no longer any particular class interest to assert against the ruling class.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Individuals have always built on themselves, but naturally on themselves within their given historical conditions and relationships, not on the ""pure"" individual in the sense of the ideologists. But in the course of historical evolution, and precisely through the inevitable fact that within the division of labour social relationships take on an independent existence, there appears a division within the life of each individual, insofar as it is personal and insofar as it is determined by some branch of labour and the conditions pertaining to it. (We do not mean it to be understood from this that, for example, the rentier, the capitalist, etc., cease to be persons; but their personality is conditioned and determined by quite definite class relationships, and the division appears only in their opposition to another class and, for themselves, only when they go bankrupt.) In the estate (and even more in the tribe) this is as yet concealed: for instance, a nobleman always remains a nobleman, a commoner always a commoner, apart from his other relationships, a quality inseparable from his individuality. The division between the personal and the class individual, the accidental nature of the conditions of life for the individual, appears only with the emergence of the class, which is itself a product of the bourgeoisie. This accidental character is only engendered and developed by competition and the struggle of individuals among themselves. Thus, in imagination, individuals seem freer under the dominance of the bourgeoisie than before, because their conditions of life seem accidental; in reality, of course, they are less free, because they are more subjected to the violence of things. The difference from the estate comes out particularly in the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. When the estate of the urban burghers, the corporations, etc., emerged in opposition to the landed nobility, their condition of existence-movable property and craft labour, which had already existed latently before their separation from the feudal ties appeared as something positive, which was asserted against feudal landed property, and, therefore, in its own way at first took on a feudal form. Certainly the refugee serfs treated their previous servitude as something accidental to their personality. But here they only were doing what every class that is freeing itself from a fetter does; and they did not free themselves as a class but separately. Moreover, they did not rise above the system of estates, but only formed a new estate, retaining their previous mode of labour even in their new situation, and developing it further by freeing it from its earlier fetters, which no longer corresponded to the development already attained.5  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0For the proletarians, on the other hand, the condition of their existence, labour, and with it all the conditions of existence governing modern society, have become something accidental, something over which they, as separate individuals, have no control, and over which no social organisation can give them control. The contradiction between the individuality of each separate proletarian and labour, the condition of life forced upon him, becomes evident to him himself, for he is sacrificed from youth upwards and, within his own class,)has no chance of arriving at the conditions which would place him in the other class.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Thus, while the refugee serfs only wished to be free to develop and assert those conditions of existence which were already there, and hence, in the end, only arrived at free labour, the proletarians, if they are to assert themselves as individuals, will have to abolish the very condition of their existence hitherto (which has, moreover, been that of all society up to the present) , namely, labour. Thus they find themselves directly opposed to the form in which, hith¬erto, the individuals, of which society consists, have given themselves collective expression, that is, the State. In order, therefore, to assert themselves as individuals, they must overthrow the State.

I am indebted to Thomas Ferguson for bringing the crossed-out material to my attention.  1. Particularly.  2. Marx refers here to the Young Hegelian Bruno Bauer, who had published in Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung two long reviews dealing with books, articles and pamphlets on the Jewish question. Most of the quoted phrases are taken from these reviews in Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, vol.1, December, 1843; vol. 4, March, 1844. The expressions ""utopian phrase"" and ""compact mass"" can be found in Bauer\'s article ""Was ist jetzt der Gegenstand del\' Kritik?"" published in Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, vol. 8, July, 1844. Allgemeine Literatuf-Zeitung (General Literary Gazette), a German monthly, was published by Bauer in Charlottenburg from December, 1843,to October, 1844.  3. Passages enclosed in brackets were crossed out by Marx in his manuscript.  4.

It included Marx\'s Notes on the Latest Prussian Instruction to Censors and Luther-the Arbiter Between Strauss and Feuerbach, and articles by Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach, Friedrich Koppen, Arnold Ruge, etc.  9. Marx has in mind Hauer and his followers, who were associated with the Allgemeine Lite,atur-Zeitung.  1. ""Moment"" is a technical term in Hegelian philosophy meaning a vital element of thought. The term is used to stress that thought is a process, and thus that elements in a system of thought are also phases in a movement.  2. In Hegel, ""feeling"" (Empfindung) denotes a relatively low form of mental life in which the subjective and the objective are still confused together ""Consciousness"" (Bewusstein)-the name given by Hegel to the first major section of his Phenomenology of Mind-denotes those forms of mental activity where a subject first seeks to comprehend an object. ""Self-consciousness"" and ""mind"" denote subsequent, higher phases in the evolution of ""absolute knowledge"" or ""the absolute.""  3. Die Entjremdete Arbeit. See the Note on Texts and Terminology. p. xli. above. for a discussion of this term.   4. ""Alienation""-  EntiiusseTung  5. ""Species nature"" (and, earlier, ""species being"")- Gattungswesen; ""man\'s essential nature""- menschlichen Wesen.  6. At this point the first manuscript breaks off unfinished.  7. Prostitution is only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the labourer, and since it is a relationship in which falls not the prostitute alone, but also the one who prostitutes-and the latter\'s abomination is still greater-the capitalist, etc., also comes under this head.   8. For this reason it is just as highly priced as the determinations of human essence and activities.   9. In practice I can relate myself to a thing humanly only if the thing relates itself to the human being humanly.   1.

In the manuscript the lower left corner of the page is torn off. Just the right-hand endings of the last six lines remain, making restorations of the text impossible. It is possible to surmise, however, that Marx here criticizes Hegel\'s idealistic ""transcending"" of estrangement ( the words that have survived are cited in the next footnote ) .  6. In ""transcending"" estrangement ""in the old German manner-the manner of the Hegelian phenomenology,"" i.e., in transcending it exclusively in the ""consciousness"" of the subject.  7.

The service launches March 30, 2015. The artists are performing a ‘Coup d\'état’ style campaign to overthrow Spotify, on the eve of its rumoured $16B acquisition.   Mashable.com writes: Earlier this year, Jay Z bought Aspiro, a Swedish tech company that runs two streaming music services (WiMP and Tidal) for $56 million. Monday\'s announcement will finally reveal what the 45-year-old rap mogul will do with his purchase.  Tidal\'s website describes the service as such: ""Introducing the first music streaming service that combines the best High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial.""   Consequenceofsound.com writes: A new high-fidelity streaming music service helmed by Jay Z launches Monday. TIDAL was acquired by the rapper last month as part of a $56 million dollar deal with the Scandinavian platform Aspiro.   Full details of the service will be announced during a press conference on Monday. However, according to TIDAL’s website, it’s “the first music streaming service that combines the best High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial.”   There are two paid subscription options: $19.99 a month for high-fidelity audio, and $9.99 for standard quality audio. TIDAL can be streamed on the web, and downloaded for iOS and Android devices.   Several artists have already thrown their support behind TIDAL, changing their Twitter icons to light blue and tweeting the hashtag #TIDALForAll. Among them were Kanye West and Jack White’s Third Man Records TIDAL joins the ranks of an already crowded streaming music market, which includes Spotify, Rdio, Amazon, Pandora, and Neil Young’s high-fidelity PONO digital store. Additionally, Apple is said to be developing its own service with the assistance of Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor.   USA Today writes: Music mogul Jay Z is expected on Monday to unveil his blueprint for high-resolution music streaming service Tidal. A press invite for an event scheduled for Monday went out last week promising that “Shawn ‘JAY Z’ Carter and special guests will announce a commitment to a new direction for the music industry from both a creative and business perspective.”   The hip-hop icon last month made a $56 million bid for the service and parent company Aspiro through Project Panther Bidco Ltd., which is indirectly-owned by his S. Carter Enterprises. The Scandinavian company Aspiro currently operates two music services, Tidal in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and WiMP, in Norway, Sweden and other parts of Europe.   The two services will now be operated under the name Tidal worldwide. The event, which will be live-streamed, will unveil “a new chapter” for the global streaming service.   Jay Z’s play with Tidal comes at a tumultuous time for the music streaming market. Apple is reportedly revamping its streaming music plan. The tech giant acquired Beats Music last year for $3 billion, but is now planning a new streaming service to better compete with Spotify, The New York Times reported last week.   Apple had hoped to undercut Spotify on its $9.99 monthly paid tier of service by $2, but music labels would not agree to Apple’s offer for lower licensing fees, sources told the Times.   This is part of an aggressive move by the major labels, specifically Universal, Sony and Warner Music to limit or close free access streaming, says Paul Resnikoff, publisher of Digital Music News.   “They’ve lost faith in the ability of ‘freemium’ to covert enough paid subscribers, where the real money in streaming comes from,” he said. “That explains the refusal to allow a free tier on Apple’s upcoming streaming launch, and now, a refusal to even let Apple offer a lower price point.”   A reason why the music industry might embrace Jay Z and Tidal? It charges $19.99 monthly for unlimited listening of high resolution music — with no free listening tier, although you can get a seven-day free trial.   Tidal’s music quality offerings include 1411 kilobits per second lossless HiFi, which is equivalent to CD sound and considered higher quality than lower resolution levels of Spotify (320 kbps) and iTunes (256 kbps).   Users can access Tidal on Android and iOS devices, computers and some home audio products including Sonos speakers.', "" You know there's something 'bout a man in black Makes me want to buy a Cadillac Throw the top back And roll down to Jackson town I wanna be there on the stage with you You and I could be the next rage too Hear the crowd roar Make 'em want more Kick the footlights out   I wanna love like Johnny and June Rings of fire burnin' with you I wanna walk the line, walk the line 'Till the end of time I wanna love, love ya that much Cash it all in Give it all up When you're gone, I wanna go too Like Johnny and June   I wanna hold you baby right or wrong Build a world around a country song Pray a sweet prayer Follow you there Down in history   I wanna love like Johnny and June Rings of fire burnin' with you I wanna walk the line, walk the line 'Till the end of time I wanna love, love ya that much Cash it all in Give it all up When you're gone, I wanna go too Like Johnny and June   Like Johnny and June More than life itself No-one else This endless promise They don't make love like that anymore Is that too much to be askin' for   I wanna love like Johnny and June Rings of fire burnin' with you I wanna walk the line, walk the line 'Till the end of time I wanna love, love ya that much Cash it all in Give it all up When you're gone, I wanna go too Like Johnny and June   Like Johnny and June And when we're gone There'll be no tears to cry Only memories of our lives They'll remember, remember A love like that"", 'CUT TO: EXT.

That will be fifteen minutes for you, too, Mr. Danforth. Count ‘em.  Chad’s face falls.  TAYLOR: (in a low voice) Could be tough for Chad. He can’t count that high.  MISS DARBUS: Taylor McKessie, fifteen minutes.  Talot looks stunned. Chad looks back at her and Jason smiles. Miss Darbus slaps a ruler on the desk.  MISS DARBUS: Shall the carnage continue?

GABRIELLA: I don’t-  TROY: Beleive it!  GABRIELLA: Well, me-  TROY: Either. But how?  GABRIELLA: Well my mom’s company transferred her here to Albuquerque. I can’t believe you live here.

Well my friends know about the snowboarding. Um, I haven’t quite told them about the singing thing.  STUDENT: Hey what’s up Troy?  TROY: (to student) Hey  GABRIELLA: Too much for them to handle?  TROY: No, it was cool. But you know my friends, it’s uh… It’s not what I do. That was like, a different person.  Gabriella suddenly turns and goes down a hallway as Troy finishes his sentence. He follows.  TROY: So, uh, anyway, welcome to East High! Oh and now that you’ve met Ms. Darbus I bet you just can’t wait to sign up for that.  Troy points to the audition sign-up sheet for the winter musical tacked on a bulletin board.  GABRIELLA: I won’t be signing up for anything for a while. I just wanna get to know the school. But if you sign up, I’d consider coming to see the show.  TROY: Yeah, yeah. That’s completely impossible.  Gabriella chuckles. Sharpay suddenly appears from behind the bulletin board.  SHARPAY: What’s impossible Troy? I wouldn’t think “impossible” is even in your vocabulary. Oh, so nice of you to show our new classmate aound.  Troy and Gabriella share a look. Sharpay signs her name in red ink in huge letters under “Pairs audition”. Troy and Sharpay grimace.  SHARPAY: Oh, were you going to sign up too?  Troy and Gabriella look at each other.  SHARPAY: My brother and I have starred in all the school’s productions and we really welcome newcomers. There are a lot of supporting roles in a show. I’m sure we could find something for you.  GABRIELLA: (shaking her head) No, no, no. I was just looking at all the bulletin boards. (Troy crosses his arms, smiles and nods) Lots going on at this school. Wow. Nice penmanship.  Gabriella walks off and Troy begins to walk off too.  SHARPAY: So, Troy, (Troy stops and looks back as Sharpay approaches) I missed you during vacation. What’d you do?  TROY: Oh, you know, uh, played basketball, snowboarding, more basketball.  SHARPAY: When’s the big game?  TROY: Uh, two weeks. (Troy holds up two fingers)  SHARPAY: You are so dedicated… Just like me!  TROY: Ah, ha.  SHARPAY: I hope you come watch me in the musical. Promise?  Troy nods, then turns to go.  SHARPAY: Toodles!

Chad gets up.  CHAD: Troy. (Chad stretches his arms.) Look, the music in those shows isn\'t hip-hop, okay, or rock, or anything essential to culture. It\'s like, show music. It\'s all costumes and makeup. Oh, dude, it\'\'s frightenting. (Chad shivers.)  TROY: Yeah, I know. I just thought it might be a good laugh, you know. Sharpay\'s kinda cute too.

SHARPAY: Well it\'s pretty much basketball 24/7 with him.  GABRIELLA: (looking at the chalkboard) That should be sixteen over pi.  The pregnant science teacher turns to look at Gabriella.  TEACHER: Yes, Miss Montez?  GABRIELLA: I\'m sorry, I was just... uh... Shouldn\'t the second equation read sixteen over pi?  Sharpay rolls her eyes.  TEACHER: Sixteen over pi?

DARBUS: And we, Bolton, are in the midst of auditions for our winter musicale as well! This school is about more than just young men in baggy shorts flinging balls for touchdowns!  COACH BOLTON: Baskets! They shoot baskets!  PRINCIPAL MATSUI: Stop! Guys, listen. You\'ve been having this arguement since the day you both started teaching here.

Chad looks puzzled as Troy hurries off.  CHAD: Homework? There\'s no way.  Troy slinks into a classroom and Chad follows. He watches Troy greet a few students.  CHAD: (whispering to himself) What\'s he doing?  A student shakes Chad\'s hand and enters the classroom.  CHAD: Hey, how\'s it going man?  Troy disappers and Chad looks baffled. In the hallway, Troy sneaks away behind him. Troy hurries down a stairwell. Farther up, Chad stares down with a confused look.  CUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH, DAY  Troy strikes a casual pose as a teacher walks by. He sneaks ahead. Coach Bolton emerges from the building and Troy hides behind a wall. With a furrowed brow, Coach Bolton steps over to see no one.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GARAGE, DAY  Troy hurries through an auto class.  CUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH, DAY  Coach Bolton has a curious look as he steps away.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GARAGE, DAY  Troy sneaks to a door past a faculty member, who notices him.  TROY: Short cut.  The faculty member looks at his watch. Troy opens the door to a hallway and leans on it.  TROY: I\'m late for class.  The faculty member nods and Troy smiles, sheepishly running on. The faculty member shakes his head.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH THEATER, DAY  Troy walks backstage and hides behind a janitor\'s cart. He stops behind a prop camel and peers out. Troy glances across the stage at a piano, then eyes the camel\'s tassles and over-size glasses. He sneaks behind a curtain and watches as Ms. Darbus and theater kids walk in. Troy backs away as Ms. Darbus approaches the stage. Ms. Darbus claps for attention and takes center stage as the students sit down.  MS. DARBUS: This is where the true expression of the artist is realized, where inner truth is revealed through the actor\'s journey where - (school bell rings) was that a cell phone?  Students check their pockets.  KELSI: No ma\'am, that was the warning bell.  MS. DARBUS: Ah, (touching her glasses) Those wishing to audition must understand that time is of the essence. (Troy walks though the auditorium still hiding behind the mop in the janitor\'s cart, stopping to hear.) We have many roles to cast and final callbacks will be next week. First you will sing a few bars and I will give you a sense of whether or not the theater is your calling. (tipping her glasses) Better to hear it from me now than from your friends later. Our composer (gesturing towards her) Kelsi Nielson will accompany you and be avaliable for rehearsals prior to callbacks. Shall we?  Kelsi plays piano for auditions and mouths the lyrics. Ms. Darbus listens as Sharpay and Ryan grimace.  GIRL: (singing off-key) It\'s hard to believe that I couldn\'t see that you were always right beside me. (snapping fingers) This feeling\'s like no other. I want you to know. (holding hands to chest and hesitating)  MS. DARBUS: Uh-huh, yes. Thank you. (yelling) Next!  ALAN: (singing monotonously) It\'s hard to believe that I couldn\'t (reading at hand) sneeze... see (Sharpay watches, mouth gaping) that you were always (Ms. Darbus shakes her hand in protest as she drinks from a travel mug) next to-beside me. This feeling\'s like no other...  MS. DARBUS: Alan, I admire your pluck. As for your singing, that\'s a wonderful tie you\'re wearing. (yelling) Next!  Alan touches his tie and smiles. Ms. Darbus takes notes.  GIRL: (leaning on the piano, singing off-key) It\'s hard to believe that I couldn\'t see that you were always right beside me. This feeling\'s like no other I want you to know.  MS. DARBUS: Uh, stop.  CINDRA: (high-pitched)So lonely before I finally found what I\'ve been looking for...  Sharpay and Ryan cover an ear and grimace. Kelsi stops playing the piano. Ms. Darbus covers her ears.  MS. DARBUS: Ah, Cindra what courage to pursue a note that has not been accessed in the natural world. Bravo! Brava! Perhaps the spring musicale.  Kelsi gives Cindra a look. Cindra scoffs and heads off.  A student leaps onto the stage, pirohuettes and poses. Sharpay holds a hand to her chest. The sudent leaps in the air then continues off-stage. There is a loud crash. Kelsi and Ms. Darbus look concerned.  A pairs audition follows.  GIRL:  It\'s hard to believe. (opening arms wide) That I could not see (covering eyes with hands)  BOY: See (covers eyes with hand in a sweeping motion)  GIRL: That you were right there beside me (the pair face each other and wiggle their arms) Thought I was alone (Ryan looks tranced) With no one to hold  BOY: To hold (the pair crouches on the floor and holds themselves)  GIRL: But you were right beside me (still crouching, the pair face each other and wiggle their arms)  The pair rolls around and crawls on the floor.  MS. DARBUS: Well that was just... very disturbing. Go see a counselor. Next!  The pair walks offstage.  Gabriella walks up to Troy, who is still hiding behind the janitor\'s cart.  GABRIELLA: Hey!  Troy is startled.  GABRIELLA: So you decided to sign up for something?  TROY: Uh... No! You?  GABRIELLA: No. Why are you hiding behind a mop?  Troy gives a chuckle and moves the cart away.  GABRIELLA: Your friends don\'t know you\'re here, right?  TROY: Right.  Both nod.  Onstage a student opens her mouth to sing, but hesitates, standing still.  MS. DARBUS: Thank you, next.  The student runs off.  TROY: Uh, Ms. Darbus is a little... harsh.  GABRIELLA: The wildcat superstar is afraid?  TROY: No, no. I\'m not afraid. I\'m just, scared.  GABRIELLA: Me too... usually.  MS. DARBUS: And for the lead roles of Minnie and Arnold, we only have one couple signed up, Sharpay and Ryan. I think it might be useful for you to give us a sense of why we gather in this hallowed hall.  The twins stand. Sharpay flings her sequin jacket over her shoulder and stops Ryan to walk in front. Ryan rolls his eyes. Gabriella and Troy take seats in the back. Shrapay and Ryan walk onstage. Kelsi puts a hand up.  KELSI: What key?  RYAN: Oh, we had our rehearsal pianist do an arrangement.  KELSI: Oh.  Ryan walks into place and puts on his hat. Students holds up their microphones. Sharpay snaps and the curtain closes. Behind the curtain, Sharpay and Ryan perform vocal excercises and hand movements. What I\'ve Been Looking For(As the song begins, Sharpay and Ryan stick their hands out the curtain and snap. The curtain rises and they take the microphones to sing. They casually walk on stage and break into poses. They snap side to side and point to one another. Sharpay does a step-touch while Ryan does jazz squares. Ryan passes behind Sharpay. They point to one another. They turn, pretending to be lost, then sing back to back. Sharpay hands Ryan the microphone and tap dances. Ryan hands Sharpay back her microphone and she continues to sing. Ryan does a one-handed cartwheel. Sharpay and Ryan lean on their knees and pretend to zip their mouths closed. Sharpay covers Ryan\'s eyes and taps his shoulder. Sharpay spins away from Ryan. Ryan sings directly into the microphone, lifting it up as he moves his head. Sharpay flips her hair back and points to the audience. Ryan and Sharpay walk and snap rythmically across stage. They stop and change directions. Sharpay bumps into Ryan and gives him annoyed look, quickly returning to a smile. They hug themselves and slide in front of/behind each other. They hold each other\'s microphones and dance. Ryan twirls Sharpay and does a jazzhand. They skip back and forth. Ryan and Sharpay strike poses then freeze in place.)  SHARPAY: (in a hushed tone) I told you not to do the jazz squares.  RYAN: It\'s a crowd favorite. Everybody loves a good jazz square.  Sharpay glares at Kelsi, who begins to clap, as do the stagehands. They bow and curtsey.  MS. DARBUS: (standing up) Well, are there any last-minute sign-ups?  RYAN: (speaking to a girl) Don\'t be discouraged. The theater needs more than just singers. It needs fans too. buy tickets.  Kelsi runs up to Sharpay.  KELSI: Actually, if you do that part with that particular song, I imagined it much slower.  SHARPAY: If we do the part?  Sharpay smirks and looks around.  SHARPAY: Kelsi, my sawed-off Sondheim, I\'ve been in seventeen school productions and how many times have your compositions been selected?  KELSI: This would be the first?  SHARPAY: Which tells us what?  KELSI: Uh, I need to write you more solos?  SHARPAY: No, it tells us that you do not offer direction, suggestion, or commentary. And you should be thankful that me and Ryan are here to lift your music out of it\'s current obscurity. Are we clear?  KELSI: Yes ma\'am. I mean, Sharpay.  Sharpay smiles and holds the microphone close.  SHARPAY: (waving) Nice talking to you.  Sharpay saunters away.  MS. DARBUS: Any last minute sign-ups?  Gabriella looks at Troy.  TROY: (whispering) We should go.  MS. DARBUS: No? Good. Done.  Ms. Darbus starts to leave. Gabriella steps out.  GABRIELLA: I\'d like to audition, Ms. Darbus.  TROY: (whispering) What!  Troy looks shocked and motions that his mind is blown. He spins and covers his eyes.  MS. DARBUS: Timeliness means something in the world of theater, young lady. The individual auditions are long over and there are simmply no other pairs.  TROY: I\'ll sing with her!  Troy steps out and puts his hand up.  MS. DARBUS: Troy Bolton, where is your sports possee or whatever it\'s called?  TROY: Team.  MS. DARBUS: Ahh. (walking towards the pair)  TROY: But I\'m here alone. Actually I\'m here to sing with her.  MS. DARBUS: Yes, well, we take these shows very seriously here at East High. I called for the pairs audition and you didn\'t respond. Free period is now over.  Ms. Darbus begins walking away.  TROY: She has an amazing voice.  MS. DARBUS: Perhaps the next musical.  Kelsi gets up from the piano bench and picks up a stack of music sheets. She trips and they go flying. Gabriella and Troy run over to her to help pick them up.  TROY: You\'re a composer. You wrote the song Ryan and Sharpay just sang?  Kelsi stares.  TROY: And the entire show?  Kelsi nods.  TROY: Well that\'s really cool. I, uh, (Troy holds out his hand) can\'t wait to hear the rest of the show.  Kelsi takes his hand and he helps her up.  TROY: So, why are you so afriad of Ryan and Sharpay. I mean, it is your show.  KELSI: It is?  TROY: Isn\'t the composer of the show kind of like the playmaker in basketball?  KELSI: Playmaker?  TROY: You know the one that makes everyone else look good. I mean, without you there is no show. You\'re the playmaker, Kelsi.  KELSI: I am?  Troy nods.  KELSI: Do you want to hear how the duet is supposed to sound?  Kelsi sits at the piano. Gabriella and Troy step over as Kelsi sets up sheet music and plays. Kelsi looks pointedly at the music then Troy. What I\'ve Been Looking For (Reprise)(Troy and Gabriella sing the duet as Kelsi plays the piano.)  TROY: Woah, it\'s nice.  MS. DARBUS: (standing out) Bolton, Montez - you have a callback. Kelsi give them the duet from the second act. Work on it with them.  KELSi: All right. If you guys want to rehearse I\'m usually here free period and after school, and even sometimes during biology class. You can come and rehearse anytime. Or you can come to my house for breakfast. I have a piano, we can rehearse there. After school, before school - whatever works. After basketball class...  Troy flips through the sheets.  TROY: What?  CUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ENTRANCE, DAY  SHARPAY: (V.O.) Callback!  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAY, DAY  SHARPAY: Ahh!  Sharpay fans herself as she and her brother stare at the callback sheet.  RYAN: (reading from the Call Back sheet) Callback for roles Arnold and Minnie next Thursday, 3:30 PM. Ryan and Sharpay Evans. Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton.  SHARPAY: Is this some kind of joke? They didn\'t even audition!  RYAN: Maybe we\'re being punked.  SHARPAY: What?  RYAN: Maybe we\'re being filmed right now. Maybe we\'ll get to meet Ashton.  SHARPAY: Oh shut up Ryan!  Zeke, Chad, and Jason walk up beside them and laugh.  CHAD: What\'s wrong?  The basketball players read the list. Chad\'s face falls and the boys looks confused.  CHAD: What?  Chad glances at Ryan and Sharpay in disbelief before walking away. Sharpay storms off and the others step up for a closer look.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH CAFETERIA  (On the middle level of the cafeteria, Sharpay paces back and forth in front of the railing. Behind her is the thespian posse including Ryan and Kelsi.)  SHARPAY: How dare she sign up? I\'ve already chosen colors for my dressing room!  RYAN: And she hasn\'t even asked our permission to join the drama club.  Sharpay slams the table.  SHARPAY: Someone\'s gotta tell her the rules.  RYAN: Exactly. (Ryan pauses) And what are the rules?  Sharpay scoffs and walks back to the railing. The camera pans to Chad at a table with jocks and cheerleaders. Behind them, Zeke paces on the platform.  Stick to the Status Quo(Zeke begins to sing and gets his group\'s attention. He throws a ball to another guy. He steps up and puts his arms around Chad and another jock. The group encourages everyone to move closer. The group looks confused when Zeke tells them he loves to bake. The group dances and pushes down Zeke into his seat.  At the braniacs table, Martha reads a book and begins to sing. Her friends put their hands towards her and encourage her to share. Martha stands and strikes some hip-hop poses. The braniacs shake their hands no and motion to be quiet. The braniacs take their books and dance. They point to the books and wag their fingers at Martha.At the skater table, another guy begins to share his secret. He plays a cello and motions playing it with his hands. The skaters shake their hands and heads dramatically. They motion skateboarding and shake their arms.  Sharpay and Ryan watch the students at the lunch tables below in synchronized dance. The skater plays cello. A cheerleader plays with a basketball. A student break dances on the floor. Martha dances on a table with a jock. A cheerleader ruffles Chad\'s hair. He tosses a basketball behind him and rolls on the floor before leaping to his feet. The scene becomes more and more chatoic as the different groups begin to intermingle.  Sharpay sing in protest as she paces behind the rail. The students begin to become self-conscious and retreating back to their circles. Ryan joins Sharpay at the rail. Sharpay puts a hand up to stop  Ryan and sing. They sing together.  The students are all seated. The skater pops up from the table and is pulled down by his posse. Martha stands and her posse shakes their hands. Zeke puts a knee up on the table seat, holding crème brûlée. The jocks put their fingers to their hands and Zeke\'s crème brûlée flips over.  Sharpay yells. Taylor and Gabriella walk in.)  GABRIELLA: Why is everybody staring at you?  TAYLOR: Not me, you.  GABRIELLA: (distressed) Because of the callbacks? I can\'t have people staring at me! I really can\'t! (Cont.) Stick to the Status Quo(The students perform a synchronized dance at the lunch tables. Sharpay and Ryan walk down the stairs as the other students continue dancing. Taylor and Gabriella walk through the crowd. Gabriella slips in milk and her cheese fries land on Sharpay.)  SHARPAY: Ahhh!  Gabriella tries to wipe Sharpay\'s jacket. The jocks stare.  GABRIELLA: I am so sorry.  Taylor steers her away. Chad grabs hold of Troy.  CHAD: You do not want to get into that man. (pointing to Sharpay) Too much drama.  TROY: Yeah.  MS. DARBUS: What is going on here?  The cafeteria stares at Sharpay. She takes a deep breath.  SHARPAY: Look at this! That Gabriella girl just dumped her lunch on me, on purpose. It\'s all part of their plan to ruin our musical. And Troy and his baskeball robots are obviously behind it. Why do you think he auditioned? After all the hard work you\'ve put into the show, it just doesn\'t seem right!  Students move aside as Sharpay runs upstairs. Ms. Darbus walks off. Ryan looks down at the cheese fries.  TROY: (to Chad) What\'s up?  CHAD: What\'s up? Oh, let\'s see... um. You missed free period workout yesterday to audition for some heinous musical And now suddenly people are... confessing.  Chad pulls Zeke towards them. Zeke still hold the crème brûlée.  CHAD: Yeah, and Zeke. Zeke is baking. Crème brûlée!  TROY: Oh what\'s that?  ZEKE: Oh, it\'s a creamy custard-like filling with a caramelized surface. It\'s really satisfying.  Troy and Zeke nod their heads excitedly.  CHAD: Shut up Zeke!  Zeke\'s face falls and he walks up to the skater. The fist bump. CHad and Troy go to the table.  CHAD: Look, you see what\'s happening here man? Our team is coming apart because of your singing thing. Even the drama geeks and the braniacs suddenly think they can... talk to us. Look the skater dudes are mingling. (Chad points to the skaters talking with Zeke) Suddenly people think that they can do other stuff. Stuff that is not their stuff. They\'ve got you thinking about show tunes when we\'ve got a playoff game next week.  CUT TO: INT. MEN\'S LOCKER ROOM, DAY  Coach Bolton sits at his desk. He has a pencil behind his ear and eats a sandwich. He reads a newspaper showing Troy shooting a layup. The headline reads, ""Knights to battle Wildcats for District Playoffs"". Ms. Darbus walks in. Teen boys in towels see her as they emerge from the showers and she averts her eyes. Someone throws a towel which nearly hits her. Ms. Darbus enters Coach Bolton\'s office, shakes her scarf, and removes her glasses. He looks up.  MS. DARBUS: Alright Bolton. Cards on the table right now.  COACH BOLTON: Huh?  MS. DARBUS: You\'re tweaked because I put your stars in detention and now you\'re getting even.  COACH BOLTON: What are you talking about Darbus? (putting down his newspaer)  MS. DARBUS: Your all-star son turned up at my audition. Now I give every student an even chance, which is a long and honorable tradition in the theater. Something you wouldn\'t understand, but if her is planning any sort of practical joke in my chapel of the arts-  COACH BOLTON: Troy doesn\'t even sing.  MS. DARBUS: Oh, well, you\'re wrong about that, but I will not allow my ""Twinkle Towne"" musicale to be made into farce.  COACH BOLTON: ""Twinkle Towne""?  MS. DARBUS: See, I knew it. (wagging a finger)  COACH BOLTON: (smiling) Hey...  MS. DARBUS: I knew it. (putting on her glasses)  Ms. Darbus storms out.  COACH BOLTON: Sounds like a winner. Good luck on Broadway.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH CAFETERIA, DAY  GABRIELLA: Is Sharpay really really mad at me? I said I was sorry.  TAYLOR: Look, no one has beaten Sharpay out for a musical since kindergarten.  GABRIELLA: I wasn\'t trying to beat anyone out. We didn\'t even audition, we were just singing.  TAYLOR: You won\'t convince Sharpay of that. I\'m telling you, if that girl could figure out a way to play both Romeo and Juliet, her own brother would be aced out of a job.  GABRIELLA: I told you, it just happened, but I liked it. A lot. Did you ever feel like there\'s this whole other person inside of you just looking for a way to come out?  TAYLOR: Not really, no.  They look at each other, smile, and chuckle. The school bell rings.  TAYLOR: Let\'s go.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY  Zeke walks up to Sharpay\'s locker.  ZEKE: Hey Sharpay. Um, I just thought since Troy Bolton\'s gonna be in your show...  SHARPAY: (puts a finger up to silence him) Troy Bolton is not in my show.  Sharpay pulls a shirt on a hanger from her locker.  ZEKE: OK, um. Well I just thought maybe, uh, you could watch me play ball sometime.  SHARPAY: I\'d rather stick pins in my eyes.  ZEKE: Wouldn\'t that be awfully uncomfortable?  SHARPAY: Evaporate tall person!  Sharpay slams the locker and walks away. Zeke watches.  ZEKE: I bake! If that helps...  Looking dejected, he leans against the wall.The camera cuts to Gabriella at her locker. As she opens it, a piece of paper falls. She opens it and smiles. She puts it back in her locker.  CUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ROOFTOP, DAY  Troy waits at the garden rooftop as Gabriella climbs up the stairs, smiling widely.  GABRIELLA: (looking around) Wow, it\'s like a jungle out here.  TROY: Yeah, just like that cafeteria.  GABRIELLA: Well, I just humiliated myself into the next century.  TROY: No, come on.  GABRIELLA: So this is your private hideout?  TROY: Yeah, thanks to the science club. Which means my buddies don\'t even know it exisits.  GABRIELLA: You pretty much have the school wired, don\'t you Troy? Seems to me like everyone on campus wants to be your friend.  TROY: (laughs) Unless we lose.  GABRIELLA: Well I\'m sure it\'s tricky being the coach\'s son.  TROY: Makes me practice a little harder, I guess. I don\'t know what he\'s gonna say when he finds out about the singing.  GABRIELLA: You worried?  TROY: My parent\'s friends are always saying, ""Your son\'s the basketball guy. You must be so proud.""  Troy stares off solemly.  TROY: Sometimes I don\'t wanna be the basketball guy. I wanna be a guy. You know?  GABRIELLA: I saw the way you treated Kelsi at the audition yesterday. Do your friends know that guy?  Troy sighs.  TROY: To them, I\'m the playmaker dude.  GABRIELLA: They don\'t know enough about you Troy. At my other schools I was the freaky math girl. It\'s cool coming here and being anyone I wanna be. When I was singing with you, I just felt like a girl.  TROY: (pointing) You even looked like one too.  Gabriela laughs. Troy sits beside her on a bench.  GABRIELLA: Remember in kindergarten how you\'d meet a kid and know nothing about them. Than ten seconds later you play like you\'re best friends because you didn\'t have to be anything but yourself?  TROY: Yeah.  GABRIELLA: Singing with you felt like that.  TROY: Well, uh... I never thought about singing, that\'s for sure. Till you.  GABRIELLA: So you really wanna do the callbacks?  TROY: Hey, just call me freaky callback boy.  GABRIELLA: You\'re a cool guy Troy. But not for the reasons your friends think. And thanks for showing me your top secret hiding place. Like kindergarten.  They smile at each other and look away. The bell rings. Troy grabs Gabriella\'s hand and they hurry down the stairs.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH MUSIC ROOM, DAY  Kelsi plays the piano.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY  Troy leans on the stair railway reading sheet music.  TROY: (singing) We\'re soaring, flying. There\'s not a star in heaven that we can\'t reach...  Ryan heads upstairs and hears Troy singing. He presses his ear up to the door. He jiggles the door handle, but it\'s locked.  TROY: ...If we\'re trying, then we\'re breaking...  Troy notices the handle jiggling. Ryan drops to the floor and peeks through the gap in the door. He stands, looking puzzled.  CUT TO: INT. GIRL\'S BATHROOM, DAY  Gabriella stands reading sheet music.  GABRIELLA: (singing) creating space between us til we\'re separate hearts  In the hall, Sharpay hears Gabriella and perks up. She enters the bathroom and Gabriella panics.  Sharpay glances towards the sink and sees no one. Sharpay eyes the stalls and kicks one open, giving a yell. She turns and looks at the mirrors, checking herself out. She leaves the bathroom and Gabriella emerges from behind a wall and watches her go, breathing a sigh of relief.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH MUSIC ROOM, DAY  Gabriella sits beside Kelsi, who plays the piano.  GABRIELLA: (singing) There\'s not a star in heaven that we...  The scene changes and it is now Troy practicing with Kelsi. He circles the piano while holding a mallet as a microphone.  TROY: (singing) ...flying. There\'s not a star in heaven that we can\'t reach...  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GYM, DAY  COACH BOLTON: (walking down the line as the basketball players practice passing the ball) Let\'s go guys! Make it sharp! To the chest, come one! Pop it! Come on guys, step with it! Let\'s go!(pointing) Come on, move it! Let\'s go! Come on, guys focus! Focus! Get your head in the game! Move it!  Coach Bolton turns to Jason.  COACH BOLTON: You seen Troy?  JASON: No, coach.  Coach Bolton gives him ball, whistles, and walks away.  COACH BOLTON: Again, let\'s go.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH THEATER, DAY  Gabriella bobs her head and taps her foot as she sews a costume. She smiles and looks at Troy, who also bobs his head and taps his foot as he paints prop boxes. Troy stiffens when he notices Ms. Darbus looking. Troy and Gabriella look at each other again and resume.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GYM, DAY  COACH BOLTON: That\'s it guys. Hit the showers. Good hustle. Let\'s see that in the game.  Troy arrives as the team leaves. Chad hands him a basketball.  TROY: I, uh, think I\'m gonna stay awhile. Work on some free throws.  COACH BOLTON: Well since you missed practice, I think your team deserves a little effort from you today.  Coach Bolton stalks away. Troy wears a guilty expression.  Gabriella appraoches Troy as he takes a shot.  GABRIELLA: Wow, so this is your real stage.  TROY: Yeah, I guess you could call it that. Or just a smelly gym.  Troy hands Gabriella the ball. She takes a shot and makes it.  TROY: Woah! Don\'t tell me you\'re good at hoops too.  GABRIELLA: You know, I once scored 41 points at a league championship game.  TROY: No way.  GABRIELLA: Mmmhmm. And the same day I invented the space shuttle and microwave popcorn.  TROY: Microwave popcorn. Haha funny.  Troy takes a shot and makes it.  GABRIELLA: I\'ve been rehearsing with Kelsi  TROY: Me too. And, uh, by the way, uh. I missed practice. So if I get kicked off the team it should be on your conscience.  GABRIELLA: Hey I wasn\'t the one who told you-  TROY: Gabriella, chill.  She takes the ball and runs.  TROY: Hey that\'s traveling. No, that\'s really bad traveling.  Troy catches up to her. He picks her up from behind and spins her. They laugh. Coach Bolton walks in.  COACH BOLTON: Miss, I\'m sorry. This is a closed practice.  Troy smiles awkwardly.  TROY: Dad come on, practice is over.  COACH BOLTON: Not till the last player leaves the gym. Team rule.  GABRIELLA: Oh, sorry, sir.  TROY: Um, dad, this is Gabriella Montez.  Gabriella holds out a hand.  COACH BOLTON: Ah your detention buddy.  Gabriella\'s smile fades and she retracts her hand awkwardly.  GABRIELLA: I\'ll see you later Troy. (handing Troy the ball) Nice meeting you Coach Bolton.  Coach Bolton nods. Gabriella jogs away.  COACH BOLTON: You as well, Miss Montez.  TROY: Dad, detention was my fault, not hers.  COACH BOLTON: You haven\'t missed practice in three years. That girl shows up (pointing)  TROY: That girl is named Gabriella. She\'s very nice.  COACH BOLTON: Helping you miss practice doesn\'t make her very nice. Not in my book or your team\'s.  TROY: Dad, she\'s not a problem. She\'s just a girl.  COACH BOLTON: But you\'re not just a guy, Troy. You\'re the team leader. What you do affects not only this team, but the entire school. And withut you completely focused, we\'re not gonna win next week. The championship games, they don\'t come along all the time. They\'re something special.  TROY: Yeah, well, a lot of things are special Dad.  COACH BOLTON: But you\'re a playmaker, not a singer, right?  TROY: Did you ever think that maybe I could be both?  Coach Bolton looks taken aback. Troy drops the ball and walks off, revealing his teammates hiding by the gym door.  CHAD: Let\'s go.  The team follows Troy.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH LIBRARY, DAY  Troy looks for a book as Chad follows him.  CHAD: What spell has this elevated-IQ temptress girl cast that suddenly makes you (pointing) want to be in a musical?  TROY: (putting hands up) Look, I just did it. Who cares?  CHAD: Who cares? (grabbing Troy\'s shoulder) How about your most loyal best friend?  MISS FALSAFF: (emerging from between the bookshelves) Quiet in here Mr. Danforth  MISS FALSAFF: It\'s him, Miss Falsaff, not me. (to Troy) Look, you\'re a hoops dude (handing Troy a basketball) not a musical singer person.  Troy walks forward and tosses the basketball back to Chad. Chad runs up.  CHAD: Have you ever seen Michael Crawford on a cereal box?  TROY: (taking a book form a shelf) Who\'s Michael Crawford?  CHAD: Exactly my point!  Troy fips a page in the dictionary on a pedestal. Chad places his ball on top to stop him.  CHAD: He was the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. Now my mom, she\'s seen that musical 27 times and she put Michael Crawford\'s picture in our refrigerator. Yeah, not on it. In it. So my point is if you play basketball you\'re gonna end up on a cereal box. If you sing in musicals, you\'re gonna end up in my mom\'s refrigerator.  TROY: Why would she put his picture in her refrigerator?  CHAD: One of her crazy diet ideas. Look I don\'t attempt to understand the female mind Troy.  Miss Falsaff pokes her head out and looks at them. Both boys looks away.  CHAD: It\'s frightening territory. (as the boys walk away)  Troy sits down with the book at a table. Chad puts one foot up on the seat beside him and places his basketball on the table.  CHAD: How can you expect the rest of us to be focused on a game if you\'re off somewhere in leotards singing (Chad motions jazz hands) ""Twinkle Towne""?  TROY: No one said anything about leotards.  CHAD: Not yet my friend, but just you wait. We need you captain, big time.  MISS FALSAFF: Mr. Danforth  Chad puts his hands up, feigning innocence.  CHAD: I tried to tell him Miss Falsaff. (to Try) Really tried.  CUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY  Zeke, Chad, and Jason enter the classroom as Sharpay sees from the hallway. She pulls Ryan towards her.  SHARPAY: Something isn\'t right.  They walk up to the door and watch the basketball players approach Taylor.  CHAD: Hey look, we need to talk.  TAYLOR: Go.  RYAN: (whispering) They must be trying to figure out a way to make sure Troy and Gabriella actually beat us out. (Sharpay grimaces) The jocks run most of the school, but if they get Troy into the musical then they\'ve conquered the entire student body.  SHARPAY: And if those science girls get Gabriella hooked up with Troy Bolton, the scholastic club goes from drool to cool. Ryan, we need to save our show from people who don\'t know the difference between a Tony Award and Tony Hawk.  They saunter away.  TAYLOR: Do you really think that\'s gonna work?  CHAD: It\'s the only way to save Troy and Gabriella from themselves. So we on?  TAYLOR: Yeah.  CHAD: Good, so we start tomorrow then.  TAYLOR: OKay, the first thing.  CHAD: Nice. (to Jason and Zeke) Let\'s gp.  CUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ENTRANCE, DAY  A skater rides past a few students. Chad peers out from behind a stone post, then beckons Taylor. She rolls her bag over. Chad checks three watches on his wrist.  CHAD: So my watch is 7:45 Mountain Standard Time. We synched?  TAYLOR: Whatever.  CHAD: Alright then we\'re on go mode for lunch exactly at 12:05  TAYLOR: Yes Chad, we\'re a go. (waving her hand in his face) But we\'re not Charlie\'s Angels, okay?  Taylor hands Chad her laptop.  CHAD: I can dream, can\'t I?  Taylor rolls her eyes and walks away. Chad heads off, in a creeping motion.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY  Students filter down the stairs. The school bell rings.  CUT TO: INT. MEN\'S LOCKER ROOM, DAY  Troy walks with a confused expression. He finds his teammates surrounded by various pieces of Wildcat memorabilia, including many trophies. Chad holds up a framed photo.  CHAD: ""Spider"" Bill Netrine. Class of \'72. He was the MVP in the league championship game.  ZEKE: holding up picture frame Sam Nedler, class of \'02. Also known a ""Sammy Slamma Jamma"". Captain MVP of the league championship game.  JASON: The ""Thunder Clap"" (team claps) Hap Hadden, \'95. Led the Wildcats to back-to-back city championships. A legend.  CHAD: Yes, legends, one and all. But do you think that any of these Wildcat legeds became legends by getting involved in musical auditions just days before their league championships?  BASKETBALL TEAM: Get your head in the game!  CHAD: No. These Wildcat legends became legends because they never took their eye off the prize.  BASKETBALL TEAM: Get your head in the game!  CHAD: Now, who was the first sophmore ever to make starting varsity?  BASKETBALL TEAM: Troy!  CHAD: Who voted him our team captain this year?  BASKETBALL TEAM: Us!  CHAD: And who is gonna get their sorry butts kicked in Friday\'s championship game if Troy\'s worried about an audition?  BASKETBALL TEAM: We are.  TROY: Guys, come on. There\'s twelve people on this team, not just me.  CHAD: Just twelve? Oh no.  Chad makes a beckoning motion.  CHAD: I think you\'re missing a very important thirteenth member of our squad.  Chad hands an upside down picture frame to Troy. Troy flips it over and sees a teenage basketball player in a Wildcats uniform.  TROY: My dad.  CHAD: Yes, Troy. Wildcats basketball champion, class of 1981. Champion, father, and now coach. (shaking his head) It\'s a winning tradition like no other.  CUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY  Gabriella sits on a stool. Taylor fronts the braniacs and presents on a laptop to her.  TAYLOR: From lowly Neandrathal and Cro-Magnon, to early warriors and medevial knights. All leading up to...  A student reveals a poster of a basketball player with a picture of Troy\'s head pasted on top.  TAYLOR: ...lunkhead basketball man. Yes, our culture worshipped the aggressor throughout the ages and we end up with spoiled, overpaid, bonehead athletes who contribute little to civilization other than (gesturing to the poster) slam dunks and touchdowns. That is the inevitable world of Troy Bolton.  Gabriella looks amused. A student puts up the poster.  TAYLOR: But the path of the mind, the path we\'re on, ours is the path that has brought us to these people: (each person mentioned appears on the slideshow) Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo, Sandra Day O\'Connor, Madame Curie, Jane Goodall, Oprah Winfrey, and so many others who the world reveres.  GABRIELLA: Ah, but what is... I\'ve got Kelsi waiting for me to rehearse.  TAYLOR: Gabriella! Troy Bolton represents one side of evolution. And our side, the side of education (slams pointer) and accomplishment (slams pointer) is the future of civilization. This is the side where you belong.  CUT TO: INT. MEN\'S LOCKER ROOM, DAY  TROY: Guys, if you don\'t know that I\'ll put 110 percent of my guts into that game, then you don\'t know me.  CHAD: But we just thought-  TROY: I\'ll tell you what I thought. I thought that you\'re my friends. Win together, lose together, teammates.  CHAD: (propping up the laptop) But suddenly the girl, and the singing.  TROY: Man, I\'m for the team! (a teammate discreetly records Troy) I\'ve always been for the team. She\'s just someone I met.  CUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY  Gabriella waches a livestream of Troy talking and furrows her brow.  TROY: All right, the singing thing is nothing. Just a way to keep my nerves down. It all means nothing to me. You\'re my guys and this is our team. Gabriella is not important. I\'ll forget about her. I\'ll forget the audition and we\'ll go out and get that championship. Everyone happy now?  TAYLOR: Behold, lunkhead basketball man.  A tear rolls down Gabriella\'s face. The braniacs walk away, except Taylor.  TAYLOR: So Gabriella, we would love to have you for the scholastic decathalon. Did you wanna grab some lunch?  Gabriella smiles solemly and shakes her head.  TAYLOR: Well, we\'ll be there if you wanna come.  Gabriella nods.  CUT TO: INT. MEN\'S LOCKER ROOM, DAY  CHAD: Wildcats!  BASKETBALL TEAM: Get your head in the game!,  The team cheers and leaves the locker room.  CUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY  Gabriella hears cheering and steps to the window.

She continues on and walks along an empty hallway.)  Gabriella turns the corner to her locker. Troy walks up and puts a hand on her locker..  TROY: Hey, how you doing?  Gabriella ignores him.  TROY: Listen, there\'s something I wanna talk to you about.  GABRIELLA: And here it is. I know what it\'s like to carry a load with your friends. I get it. You\'ve got your boys Troy. It\'s okay. So we\'re good.  TROY: (looking slightly puzzled) Good about what? I was gonna talk to you about the final callbacks.  GABRIELLA: I don\'t wanna do the callbacks either. Who are we trynig to kid? You\'ve got your team and I\'ve got mine. I\'ll do the scholastic decathalon and you\'ll win the championships. It\'s where we belong. (pulling out sheet music and handing it to Troy) Go wildcats.  TROY: But I-  GABRIELLA: Me neither.  Gabriella leaves. Troy looks baffled.  TROY: Gabriella?  A group of pep members run by, cheering.  CUT TO: EXT. BASKETBALL COURT, DAY  The basketball team practices.  CHAD: (running to Troy) Hey Captain!  Chad hands him the basketball, but Troy doesn\'t take it and runs around the track.

EAST HIGH ROOFTOP, DAY  Troy sits alone among the plants. Chad, Zeke, and Jason climb up the stairs and approach.  CHAD: Hey, um, we just had another team meeting.  TROY: Oh, wonderful.  CHAD: We had a team meeting about how we haven\'t been acting like a team.  Chad, Zeke, and Jason nod their heads.  CHAD: (gesturing) I mean us, not you. Look, about the singing thing, we-  TROY: Look, dude I don\'t even wanna talk about it.  CHAD: We just want you to know we\'re gonna be there. OKay, cheering for you.  TROY: Huh?  ZEKE: Yeah, if singing is something you wanna do, we should be boosting you up, not tearing you down.  CHAD: Yeah, win or lose, we\'re teammates. That\'s what we\'re about. Even if you turn out to be the worst singer in the world.  Chad punches Troy on the shoulder.  JASON: (stepping forward) Which, you know, we don\'t you because we haven\'t actually hears you sing.  The boys agree.  TROY: And you\'re not gonna hear me sing, guys. (nodding) \'Cause Gabriella won\'t even talk to me... and I don\'t know why.  Troy\'s teammmates wear guilty expressions. Chad sighs.  CHAD: We do.  ZEKE: (pulling out baked good from his lunch bag and handnig them to Troy) I baked these fresh today. You probably want to try one before we tell you the rest.  CUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY  Gabriella looks at a textbook and does a chemistry equation on the chalkboard. Taylor and the braniacs walk up.  TAYLOR: Gabriella, we were jerks. No, we were worse than jerks because we were mean jerks. We thought that Troy and the whole singing thing were killing our chances of having you on the scholastic decathalon team.  GABRIELLA: I heard what he had to say. I\'m on your team now. Done.  TAYLOR: No, not done. We knew that Chad could get Troy to make him say things to make you want to forget about the callbacks. We planned it, and we\'re embarassed and sorry.  GABRIELLA: No one forced Troy to say anything. And you know what, it\'s okay. We should be preparing for the decathalon now, so it\'s time to move on.  TAYLOR: No, it\'s not okay. The decathalon is whatever, but how you feel about us and even more, Troy, that\'s what really matters.  Gabriella stares at Taylor, then turns back to her work. As she writes on the chalkboard, Taylor faces the braniacs.  TAYLOR: (in a low voice) We tried.  The braniacs leave. Gabriella wears an uncertain look.  CUT TO: EXT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT  Troy approaches the front door and knocks.  TROY: (Troy speaks in a hushed tone as Ms. Montez peaks out the window to see who\'s there) Hi, I, uh... Just came to say I\'m sorry  Ms. Montez opens the door. Troy spins around.  TROY: Hi, Ms. Montez, I\'m Troy Bolton.  MS. MONTEZ: Oh, Troy!  Gabriella stands at the stairs and mouths ""No"".  MS. MONTEZ: Um... Gabriella is kind of busy with homework and such, so now\'s not really a good time.  TROY: I made a mistake, Ms. Montez, and I would really like to let Gabriella know that. Could you tell her that I came by to see her?  MS. MONTEZ: (nodding) I will, Troy. Goodnight.  TROY: Goodnight, thank you.  Troy walks away and Gabriella\'s mom shuts the door. Handsin his pocket, Troy steps on the lawn and pauses. He glances at the house and wears a thoughtful expression as he walks off. He sneaks into the backyard and makes a call on his cellphone.  CUT TO: INT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT  In her room, Gabriella reads as her phone starts ringing. She picks it up and answers it.  GABRIELLA: Hello?  TROY: What you heard...  CUT TO: EXT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT  TROY: ...the other day, none of that is true. I was sick of my friends riding me about singing with you so I said things...  CUT TO: INT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT  TROY: I knew would shut them up. I didn\'t mean any of it.  Gabriella turns on her bedside lamp and gets up.  CUT TO: EXT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT  Troy looks up at Gabriella\'s room as the lights turn on.  GABRIELLA: You sounded pretty convincing to me.  TROY: Listen, the guy you met on vacation is way more me than the guy who said those stupid things.  CUT TO: INT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT  GABRIELLA: Troy, the whole singing thing is making the school wack.  CUT TO: EXT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT  Troy paces.  GABRIELLA: You said so yourself, everyone\'s...  CUT TO: INT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT  GABRIELLA:...treating you differently because of it  TROY: Maybe that\'s because I don\'t only want to be the basketball guy. They can\'t handle it. That\'s not my problem, it\'s theirs.  GABRIELLA: But your dad?  TROY: And it\'s not about my dad. This is about how I feel and I\'m not letting the team down. (Gabriella walks to her bedpost and leans) They let me down. So I\'m gonna sing. What about you?  GABRIELLA: I don\'t know Troy.  TROY: Well you need to say yes because I brought you something.  GABRIELLA: What do you mean?  TROY: Turn around.  Turning, Gabriella finds Troy stading outside on her balcony. She sets the phone aside and opens her door.  TROY: (singing) This could be the start of something new. It feels so right to be here with you, oh. And now looking in your eyes, I feel in my heart, the start of something (spoken) new.  Gabriella smiles tearfully. Troy holds up the sheet music.  TROY:  It\'s a pairs audition.  Nodding, Gabriella steps outside and takes the music. As she walks past him, he cracks a grin. Gabriella looks back and they lock eyes. He steps beside her.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GYM, DAY  A whistle blows. The basketball team runs drills.

Go ahead and put five grams of this in. (as a student pours in a purple powder and the mixture fizzez) And that causes it to change from an acidic state causing the color to change from pink to blue. Just like those pH test strips. (looking at the clock) Oh, gotta go. See you guys later.  Rushing out, Gabriella removes her apron and sets it on a hook.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY  Troy slows his run and leans casually against the lockers. He peers at his wrist, which has no watch. Gabriella runs past and grabs his hand.  TROY: Woah!

She sees Troy and Gabriella practicing with Kelsi. She looks shocked  GABRIELLA: (singing) Connected by a feelin\', ooh, in our very souls  SHARPAY: We have to do something.  Sharpay walks back to Ryan.  SHARPAY: (as they walk down the hallway) Okay, our callbacks on Thursday and the basketball game and scholastic decathalon are on Friday. too bad all these events weren\'t happening on the same day... at the same time.  Ryan looks puzzled.  RYAN: Well, that wouldn\'t work out because then Troy and Gabriella wouldn\'t be able to make the...  Sharpay lifts her brow at him.  RYAN: I\'m proud to call you my sister.  SHARPAY: I know.  Sharpay saunters off and Ryan follows.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH THEATER, DAY  Kelsi sits at the theater as Ryan and Sharpay walk by with Ms. Darbus, chattering.  MS. DARBUS: So, if you\'re telling me as co-presidents of the drama club that changing the callbacks would be what\'s best for our theater program, then I might actually agree with you.  Ms. Darbus and Sharpay share a look. Ms. Darbus walks off and Sharpay puts a hand on her hip. She sighs and looks pleased.  RYAN: Is that a yes?  Sharpay winks dramatically and Ryan follows her away.  SHARPAY: (singing) Bop, bop, bop, bop to the top, and wipe away your inhibitions. Stomp, stomp, stomp, do the romp, and strut your stuff.

TAYLOR: Why would they do that?  CHAD: I smell a rat named Darbus.  KELSI: Actually, I think it\'s two rats, niether of them named Darbus.  CHAD: Do you know something about this, small person?  KELSI: (stepping up to Troy) Ms. Darbus may think she\'s protecting the show, but Ryan and Sharpay are only concerned with protecting themselves.  CHAD: (shoving his basketball to another guy) Do you know what I\'m going to do to those two overmoussed show dogs?  TROY: (as Zeke and another guy hold back Chad) Nothing. We\'re not gonna do anything to them. Except sing, maybe. Alright, now this is only gonna happen if we (motioning to all) all work together. (putting a hand towards the center) Now who\'s in?

What I want is for you to have fun.  Troy looks up at his dad.  COACH BOTLON: I know all about the pressure and probably too much of it has come from me. What I really want is to see my son having the time of his life playing the game we both love. You give me that and I will sleep with a smile on my face no matter how the score comes out.

Troy slides to Gabriella and they step forward again. The audience begins to clap in rythm. Gabriella begins to gain confidence and dance a little with Troy. Gabriella steps to the side to take off her labcoat, revealing a pink top and floral skirt underneath, as Troy raises an arm and walks cross stage. He does some footwork and points to Gabriella. On the other side of the stage, she sings and motions. They walk towards each other and spin around. Gabriella motions for Troy to follow her to the piano and they sing next to Kelsi.  Chad stands up and claps in rythm, encouraging others to get up and clap too. Coach Bolton and Ms. Montez enter and watch their children sing. Gabriella pulls Troy towards center stage as a giant prop moon lowers from the rafters. Troy spins Gabriella. Ms. Darbus claps. Troy and Gabriella dance around the prop and walk to the front of the stage. As the song slows down, they gaze into each other\'s eyes.)  Gabriella smiles at Troy. The crowd cheers and they turn to look. Chad and Taylor applaud with their teams. Coach BOlton smiles faintly and glances around. Troy and Gabriella gesture to Kelsi, who stands and takes a bow. Troy kisses Gabriela\'s cheek. Kelsi points to a stagehand, who pulls a rope.  CUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GYM, DAY  The championship game is in proress and the Wildcats are down by one point. Troy dribbles. Eight seconds remain. Troy passes to a teammate. He darts across the court and the teammate passes the ball back. Troy shoots and scors. The Wildcats basketball team and cheerleaders gather round him to celebrate as a Knights basketball player puts his hands on his head in defeat.  Coach Bolton shakes a man\'s hand and carries the trophy over to the team.  COACH BOLTON: (As he runs to the team) Coming through, coming through!  Coach Bolton hands the trophy to Troy and they lift him up.  CHAD: Hey, what team?  BASKETBALL PLAYERS: Wildcats!  CHAD: What team?  BASKETBALL PLAYERS: Wildcats!  CHAD: What team?  BASKETBALL PLAYERS: Wildcats!  CHAD: Wildcats!  BASKETBALL PLAYERS: Get your head in the game!  The crowd cheers and there is a big commotion all around.  Coach Bolton hugs Troy and Ms. Darbus steps up.  COACH BOLTON: I\'m proud of you, son.  MS. DARBUS: Bravo!  COACH BOLTON: Brava!  MS. DARBUS: Ah!  Coach Bolton and Ms. Darbus step away as Gabriella runs up to Troy.  WILDCAT: (offscreen) Hey, hey! Troy you\'re the man!  TROY: (pointing) No, you!  GABRIELLA: (wrapping her arms around Troy) Congratulations Wildcat!  TROY: What about your team?  GABRIELLA: We won too!  Troy and Gabriella move to kiss.  CHAD: (coming between them to shove a ball to Troy) Yo! Team voted you the game ball, captain.  TROY: (slightly miffed) Yeah thank you, thanks a lot.  Troy walks off and Chad grabs hold of Taylor in his arms as she runs past.  CHAD: So.. you\'re going with me to the after party, right?  TAYLOR: (happily surprised) Like on a date?  CHAD: Must be your lucky day.  Taylor turns to join Gabriella and Troy breaks away from her.  TAYLOR: Chad just asked me out.  They spin and laugh happily. Sharpay and Ryan step up to Gabriella.  SHARPAY: Well, congratulations. I guess I\'m going to be the understudy in case you can\'t make one of the shows, so break a leg.  Gabriella looks startled. Sharpay laughs.  SHARPAY: (touching Gabriella\'s arm) In theater that means good luck.  Sharpay laughs and walks away, with Ryan behind her. Zeke runs up to her with a gym bag in hand.  ZEKE: Hey Sharpay, I\'m sorry you didn\'t get the lead, but I think you\'re really good. (touching Sharpay\'s shoulder) I admire you so much.  SHARPAY: And why wouldn\'t you? Now, buh-bye.  Sharpay and Ryan begin to walk away.  ZEKE: Uh, wait, (reaching into his bag and pulling out a bag with cookies) I baked you some cookies.  SHARPAY: Ew!  Ryan takes the cookies with a smile.  RYAN: Nice game!  ZEKE: Thanks  Zeke runs off. A boy shakes the trophy beside Kelsi. Troy hands her a basketball.  TROY: Composer, here\'s your game ball. You deserve it playmaker.  They cheer. Smiling, Kelsi steps away from the group. Jason is about to run to the group, but he stops and turns to Kelsi. He pulls her hat off, and her hair cascades down. He helps her shoot the game ball, which goes in. We\'re All in This Together(The school marhcing band plays in the bleachers and students dance. The cheerleaders dance at center court while the others dance near the stands. Chad does a split jump. Troy sings and dances with members of various cliques. Gabriella steps out and dances, passing by Kelsi and Taylor, ending up in Troy\'s arms. The whole group does a synchronized dance. They clap and rock out. Ryan joins in from the stands. Ryan jumps into the crowd and is caughtand lifted by basketball players and Sharpay struts underneath, taking Zeke\'s hand. The group repeats the synchronized dance. Pairs of basketball players and cheerleaders dance at center court. Chad dances with Taylor. They take large steps and kick to the side. Then, all the pairs dance at the same time. The girls kick and roll over the guys\' backs. Troy and Gabriella dance in front of the marching band. Ryan, Sharpay, Chad, and Taylor join in. Jason, Kelsi, and Zeke join in too and more students follow soon after. Troy puts an arm around Gabriella. They link arms with Sharpay and Ryan. Chad, Taylor, zeke, and Kelsi join the group. Troy and Gabriella dance back into the students. Sharpay and Ryan follow them. Chad and Taylor dance back through the crowd. Jason and Kelsi follow, along with Zeke and Martha. The students continue dancing as credits roll. Ms. Darbus dances with the Wildcats mascot. The young assitant bows and dances with her. Ms. Darbus leads a conga line.)  After all the commotion has subsided, Zeke is alone surrounded by balloons in the gym. Sharpay rushes in.  SHARPAY: (holding up a cookie) These cookies are genius! The best things I\'ve ever tasted!  She tosses the cookie behind her.  SHARPAY: Will you make some more for me Zeke?  Zeke backs away as she charges to him, kicking balloons out of the way. She catches him and wraps her arms around him, panting.  ZEKE: I might even make you a crème brûlée!  Zeke smiles.

EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY The STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over scene, we SUPER TITLE:  NEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976  2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY A live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the edge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind her.  CINDY -- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just agreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of freeing the hostages. (adjusting her hair) We repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some forty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers -- captive in the Statue of Liberty itself.  3. FERRYBOAT - DAY The ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island -- has been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN, who\'s in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via walkie-talkie.  SWAT CAPTAIN Your demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their way.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you\'ll see the copters preparing for takeoff.  4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT The screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from Laguardia.  We\'re in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue\'s head. A TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women, schoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand by the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and a fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.  RINGLEADER Good.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and we blow her brains out.  SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.) (filter; from walkie-talkie) Blow whose brains out?  5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT TIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the jutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in the whole of the statue\'s head.  RINGLEADER (O.S.) (a nasty laugh) Lady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty\'s brains!  6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY MOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.  SWAT COP Sons of bitches.  SWAT CAPTAIN Relax.  We\'ll nail \'em on the transfer.  Let\'s get those hostages out first.  SWAT COP II Captain . . . what the hell is that?  All eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from the clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head of the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:  SWAT CAPTAIN Shit.  Shit fire!!  SWAT COP Sir!  What is it?  7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS A magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic, blimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.  SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.) Christ almighty, it\'s the goddamned Watchmen!  8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT In the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold suited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting inkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who\'s manning the instrument panel.  NIGHT OWL Okay, Adrian, we\'re in position.  What now?  He looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT, blond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:  VEIDT (on monitor) Let\'s take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.  9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY A line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a thud on the dome of Lady Liberty\'s crown.  10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT TERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows nothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his walkie-talkie:  RINGLEADER Hey.  We got a problem here --  He releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.  RINGLEADER Come in.  Do you read me?  Don\'t play around with us, Goddammit !  11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT The SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared, he glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic frenzy.  SWAT COP Ignorant bastards!  They\'ve jammed us!  SWAT COP II What do we do now?  SWAT CAPTAIN We sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.  12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY A HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water. There\'s an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he swaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to reveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.  Superhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather breastplate; incongruously, it\'s a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it matches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.  13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY A TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of the statue.  They\'re holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is fumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone haywire.  TERRORIST I Base to head.  Base to head.  Come in! (flustered) I can\'t get shit!  TERRORIST II What the hell is going on??  There\'s a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison -- just as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.  Panic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of a long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to his head.  TERRORIST I I\'M NOT JOKING!!  The COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED SHOTS directly into the JANITOR\'s gut.  The old man\'s body jerks twice and he slumps to the floor, stone dead.  The TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they\'re too stunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --  COMEDIAN The joke\'s on you.  -- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As the saying goes . . . it\'s nice to see a man who enjoys his work.  14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor of the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --  15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY A sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to the nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL FIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.  While the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point behind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS and RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the statue\'s upraised TORCH.  The TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the far side of the torch.  RINGLEADER I don\'t like this.  Go downstairs and see what\'s up.  16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.  RORSCHACH Got your flashgun?  CAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and goes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits behind.  17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY The COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue\'s layout. He spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor, then strolls over and jimmies it open.  ANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one\'s different. This one\'s a WOMAN.  SILK SPECTRE About time.  It stinks down there.  COMEDIAN B-team\'s upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.  As the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched wetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME underneath.  SILK SPECTRE Why do I get all the glamour jobs?  COMEDIAN A woman\'s work is never done.  18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY The TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later, CAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their guns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a TEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.  RINGLEADER I don\'t know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.  CAPT. METROPOLIS Please.  There\'s something I\'d like you to see first.  He holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer\'s flash. All at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding light has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the floor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.  All except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who\'s wearing his special sunglasses. He pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.  19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER An edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he\'s grabbed from behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at his throat.  COMEDIAN Okay, Abdul.  Where\'s the bomb?  20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY Everyone\'s slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the TERRORISTS tied up; he\'s consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.  CAPT. METROPOLIS Don\'t cry, little one.  You\'re in good hands. (standing; to the crowd) Now everyone.  Listen carefully.  We\'re going out through the torch.  He goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the torch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.  21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER A METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH secures it to the tip of the torch.  22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT SILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.  SILK SPECTRE Should be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .  COMEDIAN Just barge in.  While they\'re staring at your tits we\'ll blow their balls off.  They look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead landing.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist hits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the landing.  23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER Gas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS\' BOMB, and it\'s a big fat one, sits in a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with UNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the COMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:  COMEDIAN Well.  They look distracted. (turning to face her) Don\'t suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?  SILK SPECTRE Eddie -- !  Suddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He turns.  One of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself over to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A SWITCH on the housing.  A TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.  COMEDIAN SHIT!  He hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to blink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An empty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.  SILK SPECTRE What about the --  COMEDIAN FUCK \'EM!  There\'s a mountain-climber\'s CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it around the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only a second before following suit.  24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER CAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once, he FREEZES.  There\'s a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as well.  25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT YET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL\'s instrument panel. He looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.  NIGHT OWL Adrian!  VEIDT Yeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.  NIGHT OWL Well, good God, we can\'t just --  VEIDT Mission aborted, Daniel!  NIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.  26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT On the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.  27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS throwing off sparks against the cable.  28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER CAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands pressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and RORSCHACH, who\'s hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off the torch.  29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT THE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator doors open, and the two of them dive through.  30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER RORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP streaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure of Lady Liberty.  Three beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.  31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT A heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an overhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.  32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER Smoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat against a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling DEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.  33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER The furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of the statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He turns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.  SWAT CAPTAIN That\'s it.  I quit.  The water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --  34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY -- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through the harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the demolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes wondering what the hell happened to his date.  Meet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR. MANHATTAN.  Down below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact -- are crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge blue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:  COMEDIAN ASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?  CUT TO:  35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT The Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.  SHEILA In the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has revoked its contract with Adrian Veidt\'s super-team.  Local police have threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the Watchmen are dropped.  On the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars surround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.  JIM And in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which would ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage is expected. (shuffling his papers) Well, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially history.  DISSOLVE TO:  36.

HIGH-RISE - NIGHT Darkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT UP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP drifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo faint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where heavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED PLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:  NEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER  38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the high-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated bubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on their roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.  A CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: ""NEW SKIRMISH ON AFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.""  CUSTOMER Crazy reds don\'t know who they\'re messing with. (indicating the cop cars) What happened over there?  NEWS VENDOR Some guy went sidewalk divin\'  Twenny-five cents.  39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT A riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from the DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.  PATROLMAN STAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!  We are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of reality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the city -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance: his standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears a path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the back of a waiting ambulance.  DET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and buttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the investigation.  BURNS Had a lot of blood in him.  HYDE You oughta see upstairs.  It\'s a slaughterhouse.  BURNS No idea who\'s behind this?  HYDE Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.  BURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.  BURNS He would -- You might as well know.  It\'s gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.  HYDE Washington?  BURNS They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.  HYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.  40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT  TIGHT ON a large placard: ""THE END IS NIGH.""  The bearer of the sign, a hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk spreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make out an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.  The NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his collar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against the kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick, cross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in response and plugs on.  At the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the sidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET CRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain grate.  It\'s a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its surface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to midnight.  The STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the shattered window some forty stories above.  DISSOLVE TO:  41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT CAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted corridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading ""POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.""  At the far end is a single door, SEALED OFF.  42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT MOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture window.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are flapping wildly.  A ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.  SHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps inside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the room.  The apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints, gaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The flashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS and an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.  The INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains of a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky glass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for his face.  He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and ever-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should be. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.  We\'ve met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.  43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT RORSCHACH\'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk dainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood. Offhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL. He tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his trenchcoat pocket.  44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT The beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls, and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet. RORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive suits.  He shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on the wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP. THUMP.  He pauses.  He\'s found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a CONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing a SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.  He reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a bizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit, rows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed PHOTOGRAPH.  RORSCHACH examines the photo.  It\'s a group shot, six men, one woman, all dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is wearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN\'s costume.  They\'re all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT. METROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH himself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we  DISSOLVE TO:  45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT A LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner store.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated -- old before his time.  He holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough to open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.  46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT In an alleyway just off the access street, there\'s a MUGGING in progress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in knot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG sees what\'s happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious decision to move on.  Then --  VOICE Hold up, papa-san!  The KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and spotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they march toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them, almost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we  CUT TO:  47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE Slow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the gimmick, it should suggest that the events we\'re watching take place in a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.  It\'s out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in an alleyway not unlike the one we\'ve just left.  There\'s a flurry of fists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--  -- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME, transporting us back to:  48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT Real-time again.  Our reverie\'s been interrupted by a SHAFT OF WHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the alley.  LOUDSPEAKER HALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --  The KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the LIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair some forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of the kids.  DREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the alleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past help.  49. INT. DREIBERG\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The security system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN\'s apartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.  DREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs it carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for the kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most peculiar sight:  DREIBERG . . . Rorschach.  50. INT. DREIBERG\'S KITCHEN - NIGHT Leaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is the aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up, exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he\'s calmly eating a plate of baked beans.  DREIBERG How did you get in here?  Ignoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping, utterly emotionless whisper:  RORSCHACH Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.  DREIBERG Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?  DREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn\'t care less -- emits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can onto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup from a squeeze bottle.  DREIBERG (cont.) I can\'t believe you\'re back on the streets.  Good God, man, you\'re wanted on fourteen counts of murder.  RORSCHACH At least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.  He reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it to DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his fingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Look familiar?  DREIBERG Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.  RORSCHACH Human bean juice. (beat) The Comedian is dead.  DREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture. His jaw goes slack.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Had a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up -- beautiful view. Hope he enjoyed it on the way down.  DREIBERG Jesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?  RORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.  DREIBERG (cont.) Well, God, he\'d been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he must\'ve had enemies.  RORSCHACH So do I.  So do you.  DREIBERG Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that\'s just paranoia.  RORSCHACH\'s head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG blinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But RORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the front door.  RORSCHACH Maybe.  Or maybe somebody\'s finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge. (pause) Thought you might want to spread the word.  DREIBERG Hey.  Hey.  If you don\'t mind, use the back stairs, all right?  RORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He opens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.  RORSCHACH You the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.  He reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo from the COMEDIAN\'s wall.  A moment later, he\'s gone.  DREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone, CAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple tunic and mask . . .  51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT A GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is far from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome desk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is ADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he\'s DREIBERG\'s age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and pale, he looks thirty.  When he\'s sixty he\'ll look forty.  VEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic patents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his office reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the like.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE RINGS.  VEIDT Veidt here.  52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT DREIBERG Adrian?  Listen, it\'s Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach. I had to call you before he --  VEIDT Daniel, slow down.  What\'s this about Rorschach?  DREIBERG The Comedian.  He\'s dead.  Murdered.  That\'s all I know.  VEIDT My God.  Murdered?  -- What\'s this have to do with Rorschach?  DREIBERG It\'s -- he\'s got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone\'s . . . I don\'t know, stalking us.  VEIDT Us.  You mean the Watchmen.  The big CAT purrs; it\'s a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red fur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a chunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders DREIBERG\'s words.  VEIDT (cont.) Daniel, Rorschach is insane.  DREIBERG I know, I know, it\'s just -- he\'s back on the street, he smells blood.  VEIDT You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he\'s satisfied.  It blows over.  DREIBERG He\'s bound to get caught.  I don\'t want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.  VEIDT If he comes here, I\'ll handle him.  Remember -- I\'ve always protected you.  Haven\'t I? (slight pause) Do you need money?  DREIBERG No.  I just wanted you to --  VEIDT You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let\'s stay in touch, okay?  Good night.  DREIBERG Good night.  VEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a cigarette.  It\'s ""matchless""; you ignite it guy striking the tip of the cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a long, slow drag.  CUT TO:  53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT Barbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the checkpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE rolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign which reads ""ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.""  54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT ADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED ESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door with a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a six-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .  . . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple doorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and wait -- to VEIDT\'s great amusement.  The inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned woman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK SPECTRE.  LAURIE Adrian.  VEIDT Laurie!  Good to see you.  She gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall in perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.  LAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized machines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific paraphernalia of every description.  VEIDT (cont.) Nice.  Who\'s your decorator -- Edward Teller?  LAURIE Don\'t rub it in.  I live here.  VEIDT And how\'s life with the walking H-bomb?  LAURIE He\'s in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.  She takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT wanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A SMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:  VEIDT Hi, Jon.  DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.) (a deep, booming voice) Hello, Adrian.  DR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under any circumstances, but at the moment he\'s downright gargantuan. Forty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he\'s calmly adjusting a calibration atop his particle accelerator.  DR. MANHATTAN (cont.) I think I\'m about to detect a gluino.  In case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just about anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the physical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of time and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.  Any government would be glad to have him.  VEIDT Supersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann caught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .  LAURIE, who\'s just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.  LAURIE Please, you guys, no shop talk. (to DR. MANHATTAN) Jon, you\'re being rude.  Why don\'t you shrivel on down and join us?  DR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable six-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist -- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:  LAURIE (cont.) Good to see you, Adrian.  What\'s the occasion?  He tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.  VEIDT . . . Are we being monitored?  DR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the little red ""ON"" lights wink out.  DR. MANHATTAN The bearer of bad news.  VEIDT We\'ve lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.  LAURIE Blake?  Dead?  DR. MANHATTAN Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington\'s asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.  LAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first she\'s heard about it.  VEIDT Rorschach\'s on the case.  He\'s got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen.  DR. MANHATTAN Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.  VEIDT What\'s your theory?  DR. MANHATTAN Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don\'t concern me.  VEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is considerably less amused.  LAURIE I could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?  VEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another part of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as we watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and floats off to one side.  A module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of the hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in midair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn\'t lifted a finger; he\'s dismantling and reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.  VEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes the conversation without missing a beat:  VEIDT I guess you\'ll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.  DR. MANHATTAN You mean Afghanistan? (beat) It won\'t require my attention.  What I\'m doing here is far more interesting.  The module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The cover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws itself shut.  VEIDT Well . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as usual -- I can\'t tell you anything you don\'t already know.  Goodbye, Jon.  DR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds his coat where LAURIE put it.  He\'s just about to leave when she arrives with two stiff drinks in hand.  LAURIE Adrian!  Don\'t leave so soon.  I --  VEIDT I\'ll take a raincheck, Laurie.  LAURIE Please.  There\'s a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his shoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who\'s forty feet tall again, playing with his superaccelerator.  VEIDT He\'s a little farther gone every time.  LAURIE Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human. (beat) He doesn\'t think like we do.  He doesn\'t even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.  VEIDT Laurie -- he\'s the most powerful man who\'s ever lived.  He\'s changed the world.  LAURIE (embarrassed) I know.  I shouldn\'t be saying this.  He\'s happy, he\'s content, he\'s doing his work --  VEIDT What about you?  LAURIE I suppose I\'m serving my purpose, aren\'t I. (pause) I\'ll ring for the guards.  She goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her, concerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest pocket for a cigarette case:  VEIDT Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine. (handing her a cigarette) Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don\'t you give Daniel a call?  I\'m sure he\'d be glad to hear from you.  LAURIE Maybe I\'ll do that.  VEIDT I\'m sorry about Blake.  He pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS appear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.  LAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman lover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and WALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren\'t there.  CUT TO:  55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY\'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT A decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood, popular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow stairway which dips well below street level.  56. INT. HAPPY HARRY\'S - NIGHT The usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS hover at the entrance to the men\'s room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS stand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and grind.  Suddenly there\'s a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.  Over by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE off the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of vicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the bar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing glasses.  RORSCHACH Harry.  HARRY (petrified) R-Rorschach.  RORSCHACH Phone\'s out of order.  Mind if I use yours?  He reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH picks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.  He turns and faces the assembled multitudes:  RORSCHACH Edward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might\'ve had help. (wandering through the room) Thought maybe you could fill me in.  ENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as RORSCHACH strolls past.  RORSCHACH (cont.) You.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing? (moving on) Johnny Gobs.  What\'s new at the schoolyard?  Behind RORSCHACH\'s back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively toward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar, yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Nicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?  NICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH extends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --  -- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He closes a gloved fist around NICKY\'s pinky finger, twists it back and SNAPS IT.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Edward Blake.  Who killed him?  No answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH grabs his index finger and repeats the process.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Who killed Edward Blake?  NICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to the floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He\'s standing poised to let fly at NICKY\'s ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.  VOICE JESUS!  HE\'S IN SHOCK!!  RORSCHACH THE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?  By now HARRY\'s pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar. Without looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It catches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of glassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the ceiling.  SILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH\'s next move.  He looks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:  RORSCHACH (cont.) So many vermin . . . so little time.  He bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY\'s quivering frame, and tosses it contemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long enough to HISS at the crowd:  RORSCHACH (cont.) Go back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I\'ll be around.   CUT TO:  57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN The bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller research complex.  It\'s not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and LAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over to where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is empty.  LAURIE (muttering; groggy) Jon . . . ?  A LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE closes her eyes and sighs.  DR. MANHATTAN I\'m here, Laurie.  LAURIE Is it time?  D\'you have to leave for the funeral?  DR. MANHATTAN Not yet, there\'s plenty of time.  A SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly. DR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.  LAURIE Mmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?  The BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE\'s shoulder and arm, toward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.  DR. MANHATTAN Would you like me to stay?  LAURIE Mm hmm.  DR. MANHATTAN I could stay and go.  LAURIE . . . And just how would you manage that?  She leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its downward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is massaging LAURIE\'s thigh.  Third blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE\'s eyes go suddenly wide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.  DR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the foot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.  LAURIE AAAAAAAAAA!!  DR. MANHATTAN I Laurie?  Are you --  DR. MANHATTAN II Don\'t be upset.  This unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE\'s fragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a dressing gown.  LAURIE Jon, please.  I don\'t enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one person again, please?  The big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical gestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.  DR. MANHATTAN I Laurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --  DR. MANHATTAN II -- you would find it erotic.  LAURIE All right, all right.  It\'s just -- my nerves, I\'m going stir-crazy in this place, I --  While fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance through a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment, she sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an experiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through the door . . .  58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER . . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:  LAURIE You\'ve been out here all along, haven\'t you?  Running one of your stupid experiments --  DR. MANHATTAN III Yes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.  LAURIE So you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how could you do this?  DR. MANHATTAN III You seem to feel I\'ve been neglecting you.  Isn\'t that the case? (pause) I thought I\'d solved the problem quite elegantly.  LAURIE That\'s all it is to you, isn\'t it?  Just another problem you can --  She doesn\'t see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered the room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:  DR. MANHATTANS I & II Laurie, please --  LAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back slowly, steadies herself on a lab table.  LAURIE Jon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I could really use the time alone.  She storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I & II -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original DR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his equipment.  FADE THROUGH TO:  1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT A pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard at work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly beautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it\'s largely wasted on her preoccupied date.  At the moment, she\'s filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:  LAURIE The government\'s really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I guess it\'s no picnic being the world\'s only superhuman. (mock-macho) I have to keep him in line.  She flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to laugh.  He doesn\'t.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has wandered off into a far corner of the room.  LAURIE (cont.) Excuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?  DREIBERG Sorry, it\'s this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don\'t really think anyone\'s out to get us -- do you?  LAURIE Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let\'s face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.  DREIBERG Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .  LAURIE Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.  DREIBERG Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It\'s a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --  Now he\'s got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then leans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:  LAURIE Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.  DREIBERG (shaking his head in disgust)  Yeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors . . . and I\'m still in the psycho file with Rorschach.  LAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.  DREIBERG (cont.) What\'s so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?  LAURIE I\'m just wondering what you would\'ve said ten years ago if you could see yourself right now. (raising her glass) Well, here\'s to the Comedian.  \'Cause the fact is, he\'s dead . . . and we\'re not.  DREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.  1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace, which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They\'re holding big snifters of brandy, and they\'re both pretty well drunk.  DREIBERG The pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I mean, we were heroes!  LAURIE Damn straight.  DREIBERG Damn straight!  We were heroes.  LAURIE Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.  DREIBERG Well, that was Adrian\'s idea.  I know he\'s the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .  LAURIE (smiling) Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .  DREIBERG Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we\'d beat him up?  LAURIE That\'s the one.  Whatever happened to him?  DREIBERG (deadpan) He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.  LAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to her mouth -- and like DREIBERG she\'s GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA PULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a stentorian VOICE over scene:  CHAPLAIN (V.O.) In the midst of life we are in death . . .  CUT TO:  59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY AN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.  CHAPLAIN . . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --  TIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of mourners.  There\'s no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the attendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons of protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off with the traditional twenty-one gun salute.  CHAPLAIN (cont.) -- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself.  A light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR. MANHATTAN, of course, doesn\'t need one -- the raindrops vanish miraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the distance, and he glances off at:  60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT SENTRIES stand at attention.  They\'ve blocked off the part of the cemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has been spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like wildfire.  MOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due respect for the dead, Arlington National\'s turning into a zoo: gawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their hands full managing the crowd.  A KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to join the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.  It\'s not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled marble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward, and he\'s cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms, Pieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze plaque bears the inscription:  IN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM  Below it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four hundred of them.  61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT The Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE\'s home sweet home.  Her car pulls up to the guard\'s booth and he waves her through.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind her, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.  62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT LAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex, fumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the card into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.  She tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls up behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps out.  LAURIE Major Adamson, I can\'t seem to get in the door.  ADAMSON Laurie, I\'ll have to ask you to come with me.  LAURIE Why?  What\'s the problem?  ADAMSON I can\'t tell you that.  It is quite urgent.  LAURIE (chuckling) I would like to use the bathroom --  As she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.  ADAMSON The access code\'s been changed.  Your card won\'t work anymore.  LAURIE What?!  ADAMSON Please.  The major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The GUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.  ADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE\'s climbing inside when she sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.  The entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging from it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION SUITS.  63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT LAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to a team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard at the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white gown:  NURSE Miss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.  LAURIE What -- ?  DOCTOR Drink this.  The DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She stares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.  DOCTOR Drink it.  64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT TECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are shifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of a human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens on:  65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT We\'re watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A donut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot, foot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to the anteroom.  Through a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head wedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right as she wonders just what the hell is going on.  66. INT. DOCTOR\'S OFFICE - NIGHT A MAN\'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.  LAURIE (O.S.) That\'s Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon\'s military liaison.  LAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table surrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent SCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken from a thick sheaf.  LAURIE (cont.) Dr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon\'s research teams.  The quantum-whatever.  SCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It\'s a group shot of the Watchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE\'s closet.  LAURIE hesitates.  LAURIE (cont.) That\'s Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt. (long pause) Rorschach . . .  SCHMIDT Their real names, please.  LAURIE I don\'t know their real names.  SCHMIDT You\'re lying, Miss Juspeczyk.  LAURIE I don\'t know their real names!  SCHMIDT You\'re not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people\'s lives may depend on the answers you give. (holding up the sheaf of photos) These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --  LAURIE Then why don\'t you ask him?!?  Furious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby window.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced torturers, they understand the value of patience.  LAURIE (cont.) I want to get dressed.  -- And I\'d like a cigarette.  One of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out for LAURIE.  As he\'s lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door opens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.  He passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and tilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with curiosity:  LAURIE (cont.) Someone had better tell me what\'s going on here!  SCHMIDT Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well. (beat) They\'ve all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.  LAURIE What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?  All at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE\'s face goes bone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she takes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she\'s read.  SCHMIDT I\'m terribly sorry.  LAURIE What does this mean?  What does it --  SCHMIDT Six to eight months.  That\'s with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it\'s so vital that we locate your . . . friends.  LAURIE That\'s it.  This is all a trick, isn\'t it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --  She scans the room.  No one\'s laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to his comrades, and heads for the door.  SCHMIDT Take a day or two.  If you ""remember"" any names . . . do give us a call.  The AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches for the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking, she buries her face in her hands.  67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT A darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a two-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who\'s been watching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.  ADAMSON Poor kid.  SCHMIDT We\'ll keep her in isolation awhile.  She\'ll give us some names.  ADAMSON To hell with those costumed idiots.  I\'m worried about Doc Manhattan.  SCHMIDT What do you mean?  ADAMSON She\'s his last link to humanity.  Once she\'s gone . . . God knows which way he\'ll jump.  DISSOLVE TO:  68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY DR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He\'s wearing a navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie with an irregular mauve pattern.  The tie doesn\'t quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie magically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal gold stripes.  Too staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into a handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for decoration.  It does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the mirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.  69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY TECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green room, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.  DIRECTOR We\'re on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is that big blue son of a --  He stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just rematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR\'s face.  DR. MANHATTAN I\'m sorry.  Am I late?  DIRECTOR No problem.  We\'ll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I\'m Kent Turner, the director. . .  The DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN\'s hand and marches him down a hallway.  Within seconds they\'re joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.  LIAISON Dr. Osterman.  I\'ve got a list of taboo areas here we\'d like you to steer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you\'ll just play it cool --  DIRECTOR Doc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give us something a little darker . . . ?  DR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.  DR. MANHATTAN Will this do?  DIRECTOR Perfect.  LIAISON Now Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --  But the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by a cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are hurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON hangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The ""ABC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT"" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC underneath.  70. INSERT - TV MONITOR Stock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for their lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right and takes in an extraordinary sight.  A towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through the jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the greenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts of automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation crew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: ""VIETNAM.  1965.""  ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Dr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific mishap.  For more than twenty years the ""Manhattan Option"" has been the linchpin of America\'s conventional strategy --  We CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad thoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds a corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.  His EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey gunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM hisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met with a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads: ""CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.""  ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.) -- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a one-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding the Communist menace in check.  DANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from American Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake hands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a three-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic accord.  Title: ""NICARAGUA.  1979.""  ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.) In the famous words of General William Westmoreland, ""Yes, Virginia, there is a Superman -- and thank God, he\'s American.""  71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY A sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop of the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded news vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host\'s chair:  BRINKLEY For this live question-and-answer session we\'ll be joined by correspondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating, I\'ll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy. (turning) Now let\'s welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better known to the world as Dr. Manhattan.  Applause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at BRINKLEY\'s right.  He nods in acknowledgement.  BRINKLEY (cont.) I suppose the topic on everyone\'s mind this week is Afghanistan, where Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now since you\'ve dealt successfully with similar situations in the past . . . I\'ll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that you intervene?  DR. MANHATTAN I will not intervene in Afghanistan.  A HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.  72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON Looking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.  73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN HANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience. BRINKLEY ignores them:  BRINKLEY You\'re saying you would refuse a direct request?  DR. MANHATTAN There will be no request.  I will not intervene.  BRINKLEY Well, Doctor, it\'s widely understood, or rumored, that you can actually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the hostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?  74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON He\'s steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he\'s hanging on DR. MANHATTAN\'s every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE in the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:  LIAISON I want a phone line to the booth.  Now.  75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN DR. MANHATTAN I see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it. (long pause) I can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will not intervene.  He sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.  BRINKLEY Well, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I\'ll open up the floor to questions now.  Doug?  REPORTER Dr. Osterman, I\'m Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I\'d like to read you some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M. Weaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?  DR. MANHATTAN All friends, yes.  Associates of mine.  ROTH Let me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White. Are you aware that these ""friends"" and ""associates"" of yours have all been diagnosed with terminal cancer?  The CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY\'s taken aback.  He gapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face an unreadable mask.  76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON eyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone  LIAISON Oh Jesus. (barking into phone) I want this broadcast killed.  I\'ll run out on that goddamn set if I have to!  77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN ROTH I have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly diagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a connection?  By now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make himself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who\'s just gotten a message from the booth, touches his headset and announces:  BRINKLEY I\'m told it\'s time for a break.  We\'ll be back after this brief message --  Within seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set, flanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.  LIAISON THAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW\'S OVER!!  The three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then, PANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB THE SET.  RANDOM NEWSMEN Dr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause cancer??  DR. MANHATTAN I don\'t wish to answer any questions.  RANDOM NEWSMEN You see the future!  Did you know in advance --  LIAISON The Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP ASIDE!!  The LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.  RANDOM NEWSMEN How long have you known -- why is the government concealing this information --  DR. MANHATTAN Please get out of my way.  The LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor. SCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it\'s getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN lets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:  DR. MANHATTAN I said LEAVE ME ALONE!!  In the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no microphones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR. MANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.  BRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later, there\'s an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES, leaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.  CUT TO:  78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT The place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is overseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post quarantine notices at the entrances.  He\'s not altogether surprised when DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.  DR. MANHATTAN Where\'s Laurie?  ADAMSON backs off slightly.  He\'s not wearing a radiation suit, and he\'s understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely necessary.  ADAMSON She\'s been relocated, Jon.  It\'s strictly precautionary . . .  DR. MANHATTAN There\'s no need to lie.  I assume she\'s been tested.  Were the results positive?  ADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.  DR. MANHATTAN (cont.) Don\'t bother.  I already know what you\'ll say.  He watches impassively as what\'s left of his home is dismantled.  His mind is already a million miles away.  ADAMSON Jon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . . could you cure her?  DR. MANHATTAN I don\'t know.  I only know that I won\'t. (long pause) There\'d be no point.  It\'s finally begun.  ADAMSON ""Begun?""  What\'s begun?  DR. MANHATTAN I\'ve seen this day.  It\'s the day I\'ve been dreading all these years. (pause) You see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I cared for . . .  ADAMSON doesn\'t know what he\'s talking about, but a chill runs down his spine nonetheless.  DR. MANHATTAN My work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.  And with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves behind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at the Major\'s feet.  ADAMSON Good Lord --  CUT TO:  79. EXT. OUTER SPACE -- and it\'s about as exterior as you can get.  We\'re a few hundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily apparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily beautiful -- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white clouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing our planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.  It\'s DR. MANHATTAN.  He\'s in a lotus position, sitting on nothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage. Stars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he\'s about to leave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.  80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT Black sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so barren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is, until we see the residue of man\'s presence on the landscape: ruined quonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements, half-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than husks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a rotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.  A gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden RUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue light.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift in the sky and descends gently to earth.  The rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once more as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town of Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was once a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long mahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.  A desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We MOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and  DISSOLVE TO:  81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY It\'s twenty-odd years ago, and we\'re looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN -- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie and a white lab coat.  He\'s at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:  JANEY SLATER (O.S.) Nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You\'d think they could at least make us a decent hamburger.  JON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He\'s utterly smitten with DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she\'s a couple of years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just close enough to LAURIE that you\'d notice the resemblance.  And she\'s probably the only one in the room who can\'t see just how bad a crush JON has on her.  JON I\'ll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I\'m gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.  JANEY With lots of ketchup?  Smiling, she indicates JON\'s plate.  He\'s emptied at least half a bottle on his french fries.  JON Nothing wrong with ketchup.  JANEY Jon Osterman, you don\'t act like a Princeton boy.  What\'s a big lug like you doing in a place like this?  JON Anything for science, I guess. (long, hesitant pause) Janey, there\'s something --  JANEY (simultaneously) We should get back -- (realizing she\'s cut him off) What?  JON Nothing.  What were you going to say?  JANEY We should get back to the lab. (staring at him; chuckling) You okay, Jon?  He stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he pipes up:  JON Oh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I\'ll be right behind you.  The lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads for the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after JANEY.  She\'s paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.  His face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up behind her.  JANEY Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --  JON (blurting it out) Janey, will you marry me?  She turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He\'s wearing the pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the verdict.  JANEY Jon -- what?  JON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes locked.  For a moment it\'s as if they\'re the only souls in the canteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the door, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and one of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled JANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.  There\'s a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private trance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.  WALLY Christ, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.  JANEY Oh Wally, don\'t feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --  JON I can fix it.  JANEY -- What?  JON My dad\'s a watchmaker.  I\'ll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.  He holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.  WALLY Take him up on it.  It\'d make me feel better.  Chuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY hands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her with basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he\'s still waiting for his answer.  But before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket. He thrusts it abruptly into JANEY\'s hands --  JON Here.  I\'ll trade you.  -- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING. With a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but he\'s already gone.  She stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.  82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY JON\'s at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER\'S TOOLS.  It\'s his lunch hour, and he\'s fixing JANEY\'s watch.  He tightens the central screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal into its housing and gives it a light tap.  With a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy\'s in love, remember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed with oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST CHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of it are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like anti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.  He stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and walks over to grab it.  As he\'s putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK from the direction of the test chamber.  Mounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes, seconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it\'s 13:58 and change.  JON eyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to the reinforced steel door of the chamber.  Inside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a low platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it hears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY\'s watch on the concrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.  JON C\'mon, little guy, outta here . . .  The mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in hand.  JON (cont.) . . . don\'t wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.  He stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he\'s left the watch inside.  He looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting. Agitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the doorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of the concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete block, reaches for the watch --  -- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.  White-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete block -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.  Before his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place -- TRAPPING HIM INSIDE.  He LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps sliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams shut.  83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT 1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One of them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of MILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the facilities.  SCIENTIST -- actually, we don\'t know what happens when you disrupt the intrinsic field.  All we\'ve managed to do so far is blow a few concrete blocks all to hell.  GENERAL (joking, but worried) No danger of . . . fallout, is there?  SCIENTIST No sir.  The chamber\'s radiation-proof once it\'s sealed.  That\'s why we waited outside.  The translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a dull red.  The crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There\'s a dim, distant THUMPING.  The SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect unison.  GENERAL What\'s the matter?  SCIENTIST Sweet Jesus -- !  We DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of the test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the terrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass, screaming soundlessly.  Pandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left, punching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes to a belated and painfully obvious realization:  GENERAL Say, there\'s a man in there!!  The coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One SCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --  SCIENTIST I Stay calm, Jon!  We\'ll try and kill the power!  -- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:  SCIENTIST II Building six!  Kill the power!  Osterman\'s trapped in the I.F. chamber!!  The GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.  GENERAL Well -- why doesn\'t someone let him out??  SCIENTIST III It\'s a timelock.  It can\'t be opened once the sequence starts. (to SCIENTIST II) What\'s the word?  SCIENTIST II (covering the phone) They\'re sending a crew to the generator building --  SCIENTIST IV TWENTY SECONDS!  In a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions ""IN CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.""  WALLY WEAVER, Jon\'s friend from the canteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the glass, and grabs the ax.  SCIENTIST I Wally!  What are you doing?  WALLY The power cables!!  And now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY SLATER.  JANEY Am I late for the --  She stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the lab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back through the door.  SCIENTIST III Janey!  Get her out of here.  Get out!  But she resists.  She\'s just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils have just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.  JANEY What in the name of -- where\'s Jon?  SCIENTIST III Janey!  Please!  Go!!  WALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a wall.  Sparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white light.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look at the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.  JANEY Jon.  84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT JON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his face.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch, which he\'s been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters . . .  . . . and everything in the room goes blue.  85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT The SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to tear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind them.  JANEY Jon . . . (shrieking) JON!!!  86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT JON\'s back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of unbelievable agony.  A moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a photographic negative -- stands in his place.  Then the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The iridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to pieces.  And then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim, and we\'re looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of the SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY, who gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.  DISSOLVE TO:  87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT The desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall behind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago at 11:48 PM.  For a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches the rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the door of the canteen.  88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.  89. INT. MEN\'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT TWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into the mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous thing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal cord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous system.  They pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in a haze of shimmering blue light.  90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.  91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT HORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A partially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS for several seconds before vanishing altogether.  92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.  93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT Dinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.  JANEY I can\'t help it.  I\'m going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it feels haunted.  WALLY It\'ll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that\'s all. (tugging at his ear) Do you hear some kind of -- whistling?  Indeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine. Odder yet, WALLY\'s hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY\'s. Everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish phenomenon.  UTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without warning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW suffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .  . . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them, nude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and utensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.  JANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go to her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.  JANEY JON-N-N-N!!!  DISSOLVE TO:  94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT THE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns, stares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and begins to dig.  A couple of inches down, he finds what he\'s looking for: an ancient, tattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and Janey Slater.  She\'s holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new engagement ring.  His fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.  95. SERIES OF SHOTS Quick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:  -- JON\'s black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;  -- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue light;  -- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper. There\'s a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .  -- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom cloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.  96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN Fists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in the ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at first, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue starburst a mile above the ground.  97. EXT. OUTER SPACE All at once, we\'re back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth at unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on toward Mars.  The red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface. Individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct: vast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri. Herschel\'s famous canali.  And finally, the argyre planitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling two jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular ridge.  Two eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a happy-face.  Many miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian atmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we  CUT TO:  98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN The late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN\'s press conference. As the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on his angered face:  DR. MANHATTAN I said leave me alone!!  Then there\'s a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same positions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they\'re all standing on the White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.  PULL BACK TO:  99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT A restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair. She\'s in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the big metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy furnished studio.  TV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.) -- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported a crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania Avenue!  TV ANCHORMAN (O.S.) Well, Katie, I know some politicians who\'d like to learn that trick --  LAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later, SCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.  SCHMIDT All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.  LAURIE Am I free to go?  SCHMIDT You\'re free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let\'s move it.  LAURIE (fed up; exploding) I don\'t know why you\'ve been keeping me here, but you\'re in deep shit --  SCHMIDT Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.  LAURIE Jon??  You mean he\'s --  SCHMIDT That\'s right.  Your meal ticket\'s flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.  CUT TO:  100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY The same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:  DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH Russian Tanks Advance President Vows ""Maximum Force"" WHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?  And on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS VENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:  NEWS VENDOR I\'ll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks, bombs, ICBM\'s!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a bitch --  CUSTOMER Anyone ever tell you you\'re full of shit?  NEWS VENDOR Kiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!  VOICE New Frontiersman, please.  The NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old friend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign. He rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under the counter.  NEWS VENDOR Here you go, pal.  Two bucks. (beat) Well, I see the world ain\'t ended yet.  The STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  ""EXPOSED: RED PLOT TO FRAME DR. MANHATTAN!""  STREET CRAZY . . . How do you know?  CUT TO:  101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT A row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A DRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight WOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and off as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging tipsy giggles.  102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT A three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN ushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY; his is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed -- we\'ll call him MOLOCH.  MOLOCH Now.  What was milady drinking?  LUCY Gin.  Straight up -- (mock-ladylike)  -- with a little twist of lime.  She laughs convulsively, as if she\'s just told the world\'s funniest joke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:  MOLOCH I think I can oblige.  103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT MOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The contents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen floor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It\'s a disaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in the doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.  LUCY Jeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?  On cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH. He grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen table.  RORSCHACH Moloch.  Did you miss me?  LUCY Willie!  Jesus!  What\'s going on?  RORSCHACH (glancing up) Who\'s the welfare mother?  MOLOCH I don\'t know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.  RORSCHACH Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.  MOLOCH You\'re making a big --  RORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against the table -- repeatedly, to the beat.  RORSCHACH Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.  MOLOCH ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How\'d you find me?  LUCY Willie, what\'s he talking about?  RORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor. RORSCHACH kneels beside him.  MOLOCH Look, I don\'t know what you want, but I been a private citizen for ten years.  I --  RORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH\'s chin and pulls him close.  Then, for LUCY\'s benefit, he explains:  RORSCHACH Turned state\'s witness in \'75.  Earned himself a brand-new face. (twisting MOLOCH\'s head to one side, for a better look) Hnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.  He shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There\'s a sugar bowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as MOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Comedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who\'s behind it?  MOLOCH Rorschach, you\'re talkin\' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --  RORSCHACH Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.  MOLOCH CTU?  Jesus.  You don\'t think --  RORSCHACH Don\'t know.  Ask around.  I\'ll be back.  LUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH\'s side and grips his arm as RORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He\'s climbing through the frame when he stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:  RORSCHACH (cont.) Word of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.  -- and he\'s out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously at MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don\'t know what he\'s talking about.  CUT TO:  104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY The familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a big round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world looming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a MILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight POINTER, highlighting areas of strategic importance.  ANALYST Our projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there it\'s sixty percent certain they\'ll try to take Western Europe.  GENERAL Respectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They\'re quizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.  MOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which bears the seal of the President of the United States.  PRESIDENT First strike. (long pause) I\'d like to view the simulation.  The ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.  ANALYST Optimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of their retaliatory capability before they knew what hit \'em.  On the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the Pacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf -- blossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION SYMBOLS as they strike their targets.  PRESIDENT What about our end?  ANALYST Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we\'d assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.  On the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.  ANALYST (cont.) Britain down -- Germany down --  PRESIDENT What kind of time frame are we talking about?  ANALYST Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we\'d be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.  RADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.  PRESIDENT . . . Of course.  By now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a dedicated optimist, turns to announce:  ANALYST As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.  PRESIDENT What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter"" theory?  ANALYST We don\'t really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.  PRESIDENT The weather.  I see. (pause) Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.  The SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:  SECRETARY LIDDY Dick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan may decide to return.  With a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the table -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined and tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he\'s none other than that beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at 74.  PRESIDENT (cont.) Good God.  At times like this I wish I\'d never come out of retirement.  CUT TO:  105. INT. DOCTOR\'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY A private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an examination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the doorway.  DOCTOR I\'m sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.  LAURIE Not at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.  106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK A greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near the entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken tandoori.  DREIBERG Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I\'ll tell you . . . (pause) How about you, Laurie?  LAURIE (lying -- with forced cheer) Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out. (shrugging) No expense account.  No place to live.  DREIBERG You\'ll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .  LAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.  LAURIE They\'re not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon\'s gone, we\'re right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.  DREIBERG Maybe not, but why take chances?  LAURIE Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I\'ve spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it\'s over I feel -- I feel glad.  I\'m finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --  -- and she\'s dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a damper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts to get up.  LAURIE I\'m just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I\'d better go find myself a cheap room.  DREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the door of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and chases her down:  DREIBERG Laurie, wait.  I\'ve got a spare room.  It\'s empty.  If you\'d like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn\'t.  You\'d just be all nervous about --  DREIBERG No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it\'s absolutely right.  -- I\'d love to have you stay.  LAURIE You\'re sure?  He nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the restaurant.  THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the street outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of frame, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of ketchup.  He inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down question mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he opens it again, he\'s got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.  107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET A SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant, then disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls casually down the alleyway.  He moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the crumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a small recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a shifting INKBLOT MASK.  108. INT. DREIBERG\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style: flowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc. It\'s small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative ""aah"" as DREIBERG ushers her in.  LAURIE This is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.  DREIBERG\'s lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands there for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.  LAURIE (cont.) Are you . . . waiting for a tip?  DREIBERG Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I\'ll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --  LAURIE I\'m gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You\'ve been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?  She gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her unpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.  109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG As he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE unbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door shut.  110. INT. DREIBERG\'S BEDROOM - NIGHT DREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds his hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.  111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE Another quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it\'s SILK SPECTRE -- LAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off valiantly, but she\'s heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.  An oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into frame; he\'s clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP overhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE\'s path and snatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.  112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG. His head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom adjacent.  He\'s going to be awake half the night thinking of LAURIE.  CUT TO:  113. EXT. STREET - DAY Early morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in an alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and crewcut.  He\'s got a definite CTU look about him.  MOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA DINER.  114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER A twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and pulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the nose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges of his EYELIDS.  His eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper; bizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it up . . .  There\'s a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.  A low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and sees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.  He GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH\'s arm snakes out and holds the stall door shut.  RORSCHACH Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.  MOLOCH No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.  A long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let\'s have it.  MOLOCH (cont.) There\'s a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on a case, trying to track \'em down. (beat) It\'s big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That\'s all I\'ve been able to find out.  RORSCHACH Drug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh. (snarling) Let it go time.  In future -- just say no.  With that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits there a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won\'t open.  MOLOCH HEY!!  RORSCHACH\'s stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the adjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we  CUT TO:  115. INT. VEIDT\'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY A plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it\'s decorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in an overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he\'s in the process of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure who\'s prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.  JUSTINE Now Adrian, I guess there\'s one thing everyone wants to know. Are you the world\'s smartest man?  VEIDT Oh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.  A round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!  JUSTINE You\'re certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty basic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday lives. (pause) If you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?  VEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls out his gold cigarette case.  VEIDT Sphinx brand. (opening the case) When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn\'t cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it? (lighting up) In fact I think I\'ll have one now.  Care to join me?  JUSTINE Thanks, no.  But it\'s a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --  VEIDT (bristling) No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.  JUSTINE Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.  VEIDT No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --  VEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent. He glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.  VEIDT (cont.) -- we agreed specifically --  MORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW\'s getting curious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.  VEIDT (cont.) Excuse me a second.  He goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley JUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.  116. INT. VEIDT\'S OFFICE - DAY VEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with his mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:  VEIDT KITTY!!  One last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet -- no visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his dignity.  VEIDT (cont.) How the hell did you get in here?  The curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He looks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass window.  RORSCHACH New information.  VEIDT (pointing to the telephone) Ever see one of these before?  RORSCHACH Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.  VEIDT What is that ungodly smell?  RORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark HISS.  RORSCHACH Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .  VEIDT Yeah, I\'ve heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I\'ve got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now. (beat) And whatever you\'re doing, knock it off.  You\'re making us all look bad.  RORSCHACH Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can\'t get too worked up over bad press.  He makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.  CUT TO:  117. INT. DREIBERG\'S KITCHEN - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a broiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and cursing.  LAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full glass of wine and thrusts it at him.  LAURIE Daniel -- drink this.  Immediately. (smiling) I swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.  Sucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.  DREIBERG Okay, I\'m nervous.  It\'s an odd sensation.  I\'ve always had to think of you as Dr. Manhattan\'s --  He catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.  LAURIE His what?  DREIBERG His . . . whatever.  LAURIE I\'m not his . . . whatever.  Okay?  She spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward the dining room.  LAURIE Look, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.  Let\'s not make it any more difficult than we have to, huh?  118. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN The latest bad news from half a world away:  NEWS ANCHOR Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the fighting continues to escalate . . .  On a televised MAP of Afghanistan, RED RUSSIAN ARROWS are working their way slowly but inexorably toward Pakistani territory.  NEWS ANCHOR (cont.) With Russian forces approaching the border, Pakistan today called on the US to intervene.  President Nixon has placed America\'s European military installations on full alert --  CAMERA PULLS BACK, placing us in --  119. INT. DREIBERG\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT A DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty dishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in dismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.  DREIBERG Good Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it\'s a whole new ball game.  LAURIE\'s already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn\'t much interest her.  Wine glass in hand, she\'s wandered over to the stereo cabinet.  LAURIE That\'s right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game. (smiling) God!  I haven\'t seen on of these in fifteen years.  She\'s referring to DREIBERG\'s ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it are row upon row of LP\'s -- these days, they\'re obsolete collector\'s items.  DREIBERG I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.  LAURIE I\'d say you stalled out about forty years ago. (flipping through records) Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I\'ve never even heard of these people.  DREIBERG Play one.  Educate yourself.  LAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar COMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and gazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.  LAURIE Oh look.  It\'s Adrian\'s ad.  TV CHORUS ""Oh my darling, it\'s incredible, That someone so unforgettable . . .""  120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT MOLOCH\'s apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as RORSCHACH lets himself in.  TV CHORUS "". . . Should think I am unforgettable too.""  RORSCHACH Moloch?  No reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera, seemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance around the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen, the WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her face:  TV ANNOUNCER The years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and wrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming NOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses the aging process . . .  RORSCHACH Moloch?  He creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.  121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH staring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There\'s a NEAT ROUND BULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and spins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --  TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.) For the smooth young face he\'ll never forget --  122. INT. DREIBERG\'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT LAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the TV ad.  TV ANNOUNCER -- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.  DREIBERG No wonder Adrian\'s rich.  You use that stuff?  LAURIE Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I\'m thirty-eight years old!  DREIBERG I don\'t mind getting older.  I\'m obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?  LAURIE I like the way you look. (beat) It\'s strange with Jon.  He doesn\'t age.  His face doesn\'t change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .  DREIBERG Old?  LAURIE Not at all.  You look very -- dashing. (standing up) Here, you pick one.  DREIBERG . . . What?  LAURIE Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.  Her tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then, with a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.  123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT RORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:  LOUDSPEAKER RORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO COME OUT.  He goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street outside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A CTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.  LOUDSPEAKER YOU WON\'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT\'S ALL OVER!  He\'s walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES -- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.  124. INT. DREIBERG\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG\'s stereo: an old Fats Waller tune, ""S\'posin\'.""  He\'s slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile she reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt pocket.  Dreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making him nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her hands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so that he can\'t avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on his mouth.  The PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats\' teasing vocal begins:  ""S\'posin\' I should fall in love with you . . . Do you think that you could love me too . . .""  125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS) SONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a horrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying a plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans -- ordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around under the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid, rubbing alcohol, Drano.  Almost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the burners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.  ""S\'posin\' I should hug you and caress you . . . Would it impress you . . .""  126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS) A contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.  ""Or would it distress you?  Hmm?""  127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS) RORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and rubbing alcohol.  There\'s a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied -- resting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the front door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the hallway just outside the living room.  The door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN -- creating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the puddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF BOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.  ""S\'posin\' I should say for you I yearn . . . (Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.) Would you think I\'m speaking out of turn? . . .""  128. INT. DREIBERG\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in disarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he\'s distant, panicky, unable to respond.  It\'s been a long time for him.  It\'s not going well.  ""S\'posin\' I declare it Would you take my love and share it? I\'m not s\'posin\', I\'m in love with you . . .""  He wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her breast.  129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS) INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through the kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.  He empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he ducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.  130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS) RORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper into its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from the smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov cocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.  The COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit the floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.  RORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is coming up with back way behind him.  131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS) Charred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.  132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS) A GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE hails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:  ""S\'posin\' I should hug you and caress you? . . . Would it impress you? . . .""  133. INT. DREIBERG\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT LAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG\'s pants.  Finally he can\'t stand it anymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and sits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she doesn\'t understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side, embracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.  "". . . Or would it distress you?""  134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS) RORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level. By now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU COPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.  He still has his mop bucket; it\'s half-full of water.  He reaches for his last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket, where it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.  ""S\'posin\' I should say for you I yearn . . . Would you think I\'m speaking out of turn . . .""  The COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He steps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their weapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.  The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.  135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT RORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the face.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a blimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the roof.  ""S\'posin\' I declare it. Would you take my love and share it? . . .""  RORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE ESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he\'s now exposed on the front of the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on the street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and tries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed AIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.  ""I ain\'t s\'posin\', I\'m in love with you.""  The song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL OF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street below.  136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT Three stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and lies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on him instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle butts.  COPS GET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET\'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER\'S FACE!!  RORSCHACH GNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!  In seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face topped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It\'s a familiar face . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand with his placards announcing the end of the world.  COP Christ.  He\'s got five-inch heels.  The fuckin\' runt wears elevator shoes!  RORSCHACH NO!!  NO!!  GIVE IT BACK!!  He kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off to a nearby van.  COP II So that\'s the terror of the underworld.  That ugly little zero.  RORSCHACH GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!  The van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS arrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.  CUT TO:  137. INT. DREIBERG\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE stretched out on the sofa, under a blanket.  He stares up at the ceiling, still troubled.  DREIBERG I\'m sorry, Laurie.  I --  LAURIE It\'s all right, Dan.  I just want you to hold me, okay?  -- Just hold me.  For a few moments she lies nestled peacefully against his chest.  His gaze drifts over to the TV.  Suddenly he BLANCHES.  LAURIE Daniel.  What --  On the TV screen is a huge bluescreen closeup of RORSCHACH.  DANIEL reaches for the remote control to turn up the volume.  TV ANCHOR . . . A ten-year manhunt ended tonight with the capture of the masked vigilante known as Rorschach.  Eight CTU men died in the violent confrontation at a downtown tenement . . .  The news report CUTS LIVE to the smoking wreckage of the tenement.  LAURIE Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury\'s gonna love that.  DREIBERG Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he\'s dead.  He\'ll never get to trial.  Now the screen shows side-by-side closeups of the inkblot mask and the acne-scarred face beneath it.  LAURIE looks on, transfixed.  TV ANCHOR . . . identified as Walter Joseph Kovacs, 44, a transient with a history of psychological disorders.  A former landlord described Kovacs as a self-confessed loner and political extremist:  LANDLORD (ON TV) All kinda weirdo literature, paraphernalia . . . you shoulda seen that place when I threw him out.  Talk about pigpens --  LAURIE hits the mute button, settles back and lets out a low whistle.  DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to pace the room.  LAURIE I just realized.  I\'d never seen his face. (beat) I guess it was just a matter of time.  He\'s totally -- Daniel? What\'s wrong?  DREIBERG The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.  He stares at her, obviously wondering: who\'s next?  138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING The familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID -- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement nearby, reading a comic book.  The NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic little number entitled ""COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.""  NEWS VENDOR Hey, this ain\'t a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for that.  KID No way.  This one sucks.  A CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the newsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.  DR. LONG Gazette, please.  The NEWS VENDOR hands over a copy of the Gazette.  The cover bears side-by-side photos of RORSCHACH and his alter ego, KOVACS, with the banner headline: ""CTU APPREHENDS MASKED KILLER.""  NEWS VENDOR \'Dyou see this?  This guy\'s a customer of mine! (shaking his head) I mean, I always knew he was a little flaky, but -- wild, huh?  You never know.  LONG hands over a quarter, unfolds the paper and begins to read as he wanders off down the street.  139. STUDY - NIGHT DR. LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk with a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of RORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the NYPD:  NAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph ADDRESS: Transient BORN: 3/21/43 MOTHER\'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J. (nee Glick) FATHER\'S NAME: Unknown  By now LONG is working on his third pot of coffee.  His wife, SYLVIA, wanders in behind him, dressed for bed in her robe and slippers.  When she rests her hands on his shoulders, he nearly jumps out of his seat.  DR. LONG Oh!  Sorry.  I didn\'t hear you.  SYLVIA How much longer? (staring down at the desk) It\'s that vigilante, isn\'t it.  That --  DR. LONG Rorschach (correcting himself) Kovacs.  Incredible case.  Blinded two children at the age of ten. We pulled his record from the juvenile home --  Without looking up he shoves a sheaf of papers in SYLVIA\'s direction.  DR. LONG (cont.) No father.  Mother a prostitute.  Some evidence of systematic child abuse . . . (swiveling to face her) Classic case of misplaced aggression.  You know, these vigilantes, these ""Watchmen"" -- there\'s never been a systematic study to find out just what makes them do it.  SYLVIA Malcolm, don\'t get too -- overwhelmed by all this.  SYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child\'s drawing: TWO HIDEOUS FIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair. They\'re conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and crotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title ""MY DREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.""  It\'s too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a shiver.  SYLVIA (cont.) Why don\'t you come to bed?  DR. LONG (totally engrossed) I\'d like to get my hands on some of the others.  Explosive material. (grabbing a transcript)  Mother died when he was fourteen.  When they told him, he had one word of comment: ""Good.""  SYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly, and gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG goes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.  DR. LONG (cont.) Still, he\'s not stupid.  In some ways he\'s got an extraordinary mind.  I think I can reach him. (nodding his head) I can reach him.  CUT TO:  140. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY A bare, windowless chamber, 10\' by 10\'.  LONG and RORSCHACH sit in folding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.  DR. LONG Now, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look at each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All right?  RORSCHACH\'s face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up the first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.  RORSCHACH Butterfly.  LONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Some nice flowers.  LONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third card.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.  RORSCHACH (cont.) A doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.  He shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of frustration.  DR. LONG Walter --  RORSCHACH Don\'t call me that.  DR. LONG Walter -- you\'re just telling me what you think I want to hear.  RORSCHACH Wrong answers?  DR. LONG There\'s no right or wrong.  But if you don\'t give me an honest response, I can\'t help you. (pause) I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.  RORSCHACH Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.  LONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this. He shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under the table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.  DR. LONG Well, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide to cooperate.  TWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to leave.  He pauses in the doorway.  RORSCHACH Doctor.  You don\'t want to help me.  You just want to find out what makes me sick. (beat) You\'ll find out.  -- You\'ll find out.  CUT TO:  141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY A huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns, fountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden. JUSTINE\'s hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the central escalator and swing into action.  JUSTINE Adrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?  He\'s not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and secretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the cameras.  VEIDT No comment.  JUSTINE Did you know he was back on the streets?  VEIDT I did not.  Now get out of my way!  JUSTINE Isn\'t it true that you --  He keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a pillar -- directly into VEIDT\'s path.  ASSASSIN VEIDT!  VEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN\'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and comes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast\'s agility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY in his hands.  He swings it into the ASSASSIN\'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a FOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.  As the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and slams the dazed ASSASSIN\'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King Tut.  VEIDT Son of a bitch.  Who sent you?  Arms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN\'s hair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.  SECURITY GUARD Stand back, Mr. Veidt!  We\'ll handle it!  VEIDT He\'s got some kind of poison capsule.  Don\'t bite down, you scum, I want to know who sent you!  The ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down into the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.  VEIDT Goddammit . . .  SECURITY GUARD Who\'d wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?  VEIDT I don\'t know.  I don\'t know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.  CUT TO:  142. INT. DREIBERG\'S BEDROOM - DUSK TIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.  NEWSCASTER -- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating fears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside St. Paul\'s cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from morning Mass --  A PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who\'s sprawled on his bed watching the TV, reaches for the receiver.  DREIBERG Yeah. (beat) Adrian!  What\'s up?  143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG VEIDT In have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it on the news. (beat) Someone tried to kill me today.  For a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He\'s not altogether surprised.  DREIBERG Who?  VEIDT I don\'t know, but . . . in the wake of all that\'s happened, I\'m starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?  DREIBERG She\'s with me.  VEIDT Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don\'t let up your guard. (beat) Look, I\'m going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.  DREIBERG Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I\'ll let you know.  He hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box. LAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off her hair.  LAURIE Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?  DREIBERG One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian. (beat) . . . First time I\'ve ever heard him scared.  He doesn\'t say any more than that.  He doesn\'t have to.  LAURIE picks up on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away from him and steadies herself against a bureau.  DREIBERG -- What is it.  LAURIE I know what you\'re thinking.  You\'d be a lot safer if I weren\'t around.  DREIBERG Laurie --  LAURIE I\'m an open target, Dan.  If you\'re with me --  DREIBERG With any luck, the world\'ll end before we get ours.  His sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG, fed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over behind her.  LAURIE I shouldn\'t be here anyway, Daniel.  There\'s something I haven\'t told you --  But before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from behind.  DREIBERG Laurie, I\'m not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than anything else in the world.  CUT TO:  144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT CONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving area.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward the dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby tables:  VOICE Hey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --  VOICE II Rorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --  Low, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH picks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The smallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.  GOON I Didn\'t know he was such a tiny little thing.  GOON II Little?  Naw, he\'s a big man.  Big man.  RORSCHACH\'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A SERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.  GOON III I\'d like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. . .  GOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.  GOON III (cont.) Notched up some big names over the years.  Suddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III\'s head with the edge of his dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III follows.  The others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving counter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings a KNEE up into GOON II\'s chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I\'s hair, and tumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I\'s head, face down, into a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.  Landing on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I\'s hair, RORSCHACH uses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER\'s gut.  GOON II lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby burner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with HOT COOKING FAT.  All this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two disfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked and smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in with billy clubs drawn.  As the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It sounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.  CUT TO:  145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT A prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor -- delivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of the cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are totally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal doors.  At a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door, then throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of RORSCHACH.  TRUSTY Hey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they\'re dyin\' man. (beat) Their friends are talkin\' \'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . . this whole place blows.  RORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The TRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.  TRUSTY (cont.) I\'d hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --  RORSCHACH I\'m not locked in here with them.  They\'re locked in here with me.  With that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY\'s face.  CUT TO:  146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY LONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a square table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED WIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.  Through a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across the table for RORSCHACH\'s inspection.  It\'s the same series of inkblots as before, the ""butterfly"" leading off.  But this time, the subject has decided to cooperate:  RORSCHACH A whore fucking.  DR. LONG Who is she?  Do you know her?  Too obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the ""nice flowers"":  RORSCHACH (cont.) Man\'s guts.  Falling out of his shirt.  LONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:  RORSCHACH (cont.) Doggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog -- (pause; then, smiling) -- with his skull split open.  DR. LONG And what -- split -- the dog\'s skull open?  RORSCHACH Why, doctor.  I did. (beat) He was a bad dog.  RORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass tacks.  DR. LONG Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?  RORSCHACH God isn\'t there to do it.  DR. LONG We don\'t know that.  RORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.  DR. LONG So the rest of the world is wrong, and you\'re right.  Is that it? (no response) You tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why would you want to kill a dog?  With LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:  RORSCHACH One night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.  147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK) Ruined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for the distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH\'S NARRATION continues OVER SCENE:  RORSCHACH (V.O.) \'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no word.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to intervene.  The lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up his collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a ramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.  RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.) Got a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.  He peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO HUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen object.  148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK) A DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file, flicks on a flashlight.  Mannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The light shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders over.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and on the floor, a ROPE.  There\'s a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it, sticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a charred scrap of FABRIC from a child\'s pajamas, decorated with balloons and teddy bears.  He stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden CHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding paraphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher\'s knives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh WINDOW.  RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.) Dogs wouldn\'t shut up.  That\'s when I knew where the little girl had gone.  149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK) The German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the dogs until we see what it is they\'re tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB OF BONE.  RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.) Decided to wait for the owner . . .  150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) Keys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN enters and whistles to the dogs.  FAT MAN Fred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--  RORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.  151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY RORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the story.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his reply, asks:  DR. LONG Then what happened?  RORSCHACH . . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had to break in.  152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) The FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He\'s handcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a GROCERY SACK.  He kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off his glove and reaches into the sack.  FAT MAN What -- what are you d--  RORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER into his open mouth.  He\'s got several pounds of the stuff, and he spends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN\'s face, throat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he\'s done, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER BLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN\'s head.  FRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door, and -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs inside.  Then he stands back and enjoys the carnage.  153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY DR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things up.  RORSCHACH When they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their skulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies. (leaning forward) See, God didn\'t kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed her . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did, he did\'t seem to mind.  DR. LONG That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --  RORSCHACH Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn\'t make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image. (slight smile) What else can I illuminate?  LONG\'s had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the PRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he points a finger at LONG\'s inkblot.  RORSCHACH (cont.) No right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . . just a man\'s face. (pause) See it now?  The GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a second he reaches for his briefcase; as he\'s gathering his cards, he STOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern on top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.  LONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the Rorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.  DISSOLVE TO:  154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK A rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls up outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to the padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.  After a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.  LAURIE Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?  DREIBERG Memory lane.  He opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.  155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER Inside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.  LAURIE Daniel . . .  DREIBERG Gimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.  She goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull it back to reveal . . .  THE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL\'s high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It\'s a bit tarnished from years of disuse, but it\'s still an impressive sight. DREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around to join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.  LAURIE The Owlship.  I can\'t believe it.  DREIBERG -- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.  156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on the electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin, reliving days gone by.  LAURIE Wow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?  DREIBERG I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she\'d make it down to Antarctica.  LAURIE Antarctica??  DREIBERG Adrian\'s headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along. (pause) I\'ve been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn\'t be a bad place to sit out a war.  LAURIE Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.  DREIBERG You and me.  He looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her gaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the cabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly rejected.  DREIBERG . . . Yeah, you\'re right.  Probably wouldn\'t make it down there anyway.  Behind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She\'s just opened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES -- their old superhero togs.  LAURIE Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can\'t believe you kept them.  DREIBERG Me neither.  Mine barely even fits. (chuckling) The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can\'t.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don\'t know.  It all seems so abstract.  LAURIE\'s holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing herself in a small mirror above a sink.  LAURIE God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.  DREIBERG What are you up to?  LAURIE Don\'t look.  Turn around.  Smirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the cabin.  DREIBERG This\'d better not be what I think it is.  LAURIE Okay!  DREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE\'s in full costume, looking quite imposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns shock:  DREIBERG (cont.) My God, it\'s the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender of the weak!  LAURIE In the flesh.  She ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind, and strokes his thinning hair.  LAURIE (cont.) Poor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don\'t you.  DREIBERG Saving the world?  I guess I do. (smiling) Maybe we can still save ourselves . . .  DISSOLVE TO:  157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK A massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned out; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met by CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous BOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and hawks, they\'re all frightened as hell.  Things are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow. The end is nigh, and passions flare.  It\'s anarchy waiting to happen.  MAN ON STAGE You know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They\'re sitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That\'s right -- a first strike!  VOICE IN CROWD You think the reds ain\'t doing the same thing?  MAN ON STAGE Then for the love of God let\'s negotiate.  We can start a war.  But we can\'t stop it!!  VOICE IN CROWD II It\'s pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!  VOICE IN CROWD III Dr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!  VOICE IN CROWD IV It\'s God\'s judgment!  Jesus is the way!  A HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:  HECKLER Russia\'s just been waiting for an opening.  They won\'t show us no mercy.  I say NUKE \'EM NOW!!  MAN ON STAGE You think this is some kind of grudge match??  We\'re talking the end of the world!!  The two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the stage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start swinging rifle butts.  As PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of HOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides -- outfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials ""CTU""  158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK CTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.  CTU CAPTAIN I\'ve had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.  159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK PANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their midst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.  LOUDSPEAKER CEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.  A couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles, turn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling rocks, brickbats -- whatever\'s handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.  CUT TO:  160. INT. BARN - DUSK DREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT, wiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:  DREIBERG Guess that ought to do it.  Let\'s shut her down --  Laurie?  No reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.  161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT LAURIE\'s standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her face is distraught, agonized.  LAURIE Daniel, you ought to take a look at this.  Onscreen, it\'s total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the CTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs below.  DREIBERG What the hell -- ?  LAURIE It\'s a peace rally.  The CTU\'s just opened fire on the crowd.  DREIBERG Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.  He turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.  LAURIE They\'re just mowing \'em down. (pause) This is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.  CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG\'s stricken face as we  CUT TO:  162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE> We\'re back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE OWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame, like the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws closer, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out NIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.  There\'s a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless motions stylized and surreal.  They\'re beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as the Owlship\'s powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy equivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --  -- and suddenly, the footage we\'re watching undergoes a SUBTLE TRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the action QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we\'re in full-color and real-time --  163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP -- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the Watchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St. Seaport!  164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.  DREIBERG Okay Laurie, let\'s see if we\'ve still got what it takes.  On the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.  165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT A RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.  CTU RADAR MAN Sir, we\'ve got an odd blip off starboard . . .  The ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --  166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT -- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured ship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets sputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against the water.  167. ANGLE ON CROWD pointing at the skies in disbelief.  VOICE IN CROWD LOOK!  UP THERE!  VOICE IN CROWD II Oh my God, it\'s --   168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG He barks into a microphone:  DREIBERG Attention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --  169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK Ground level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the OWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:  OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER -- or we\'ll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!  CTU LOUDSPEAKER UNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.  OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER BABY . . . WE\'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.  The crowd\'s in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But a dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the strange sight overhead.  VOICE IN CROWD . . . IT\'S THE WATCHMEN!!  EXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air, clumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging immobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West showdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate into position.  170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.  DREIBERG We\'re gonna have to shave this one close.  An instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle FULL-FORWARD.  171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP With a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS CONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond before -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES FORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD CHEERS.  172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT DREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the aft view from the ship.  LAURIE They\'re following us.  DREIBERG All right.  Mission accomplished.  He\'s no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the ship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.  173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT The OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU SHIPS rip past on either side.  174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT ASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The OWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE blows a HOLE in its facade.  175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP firing TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.  176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar readout:  LAURIE Missed \'em Dan.  You\'re aiming high!  DREIBERG I don\'t want to take \'em out.  Just want to keep \'em interested.  LAURIE (checking the monitor) They\'re practically on us . . .  DREIBERG That Detroit shit?  I\'m so worried.  He punches a button on the dash.  It\'s labelled ""TURBO.""  177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP The turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving the CTU craft in the dust.  178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT A line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly, and -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.  A moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The less-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and EXPLODES  The SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last moment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP ITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles for the airborne route.  179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER The OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the cars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.  There\'s an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges UP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS against the roof of the tunnel.  180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The end of the tunnel is coming up fast.  DREIBERG Fog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.  181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT The OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an almost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its wake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives -- but, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the water.  182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT They\'re in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of intense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.  LAURIE We lost him.  He flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.  LAURIE (cont.) Oh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.  FADE THROUGH TO:  183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT The usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving line.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall and falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of him.  TRUSTY Just left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.  The CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes through the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds, it\'s reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named T-BONE.  CON IN LINE Otis went down.  T-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of SIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the biggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET: LITTLE BIGGER.  T-BONE Just heard, boss.  Otis bought it.  LITTLE BIGGER Fuckin\' Rorschach. (nodding to himself) This joint goes up.  Tonight.  184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT Drifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale blue moonlight.  185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then disappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We\'re taking a dreamy tour of the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is singing ""You\'re My Thrill.""  Instruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one\'s at the controls.  The ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the width of the cabin floor.  A woman\'s hand reaches for it, sets it right.  It\'s LAURIE, who\'s midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG. The pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the cabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.  LAURIE Better.  Much better.  DREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile instead.  LAURIE (cont.) I bet I know what made the difference this time.  DREIBERG What?  LAURIE (smirking) The costumes.  Am I right?  DREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite himself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.  LAURIE (cont.) Come on.  Admit it!  DREIBERG No way.  I\'m not that much of a pervert.  LAURIE Yes you are.  DREIBERG (drily) No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on. (pause; then, seriously) Tonight was the first time I\'ve felt like myself in ten years.  LAURIE That\'s because --  DREIBERG It\'s because there\'s nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world\'s about to end. (a weird smile) I feel like I could save it.  He grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to the instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship hard right.  LAURIE You\'re full of yourself.  What are you doing?  DREIBERG Long as we\'re on the subject of perverts . . . (turning to face her) I miss Rorschach.  Let\'s spring him.  LAURIE . . . What??  DREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches for the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.  186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT AFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through the clouds above the city.  CUT TO:  187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON -- and as Sly Stone once said, there\'s a riot goin\' on.  SIRENS HOWL as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild: disabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons, throwing food.  188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG\'s eyes are riveted to a monitor over the controls:  DREIBERG I think we\'re just a trifle late.  LAURIE Jesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .  The MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below them.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire with the guards in the watchtower.  It\'s an ugly, bloody mess.  DREIBERG I know he\'s totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen times.  189. INT. CELL - NIGHT SIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs drawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.  190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT Smoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past sprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR MENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It\'s the psychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE, and T-BONE.  Wheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop outside RORSCHACH\'s cell and GRIN in anticipation.  LITTLE BIGGER Find an outlet for this thing (shouting) Rorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It\'s payback time!  RAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying a big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH\'s door, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.  CARLOS See this, runt?  We\'re gonna take your puny little balls off . . . and pickle \'em!! (chortling) Aww!  I think he just wet his pants!  HILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place at the panel in the door:  T-BONE Lemme see.  Lemme see!  LITTLE BIGGER Relax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve. (to T-BONE) What\'s he doin\' now?  No response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed tightly to the panel.  LITTLE BIGGER (cont.) You deaf?  I said, what\'s he --  He gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE\'s legs buckle and he topples over backwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON quivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye socket.  RAFE BOSS!  JESUS!  LITTLE BIGGER Son of a bitch! -- WE\'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE\'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE A GRAPE. (to RAFE) Light the torch.  RAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of RORSCHACH\'s cage.  191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT RORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.  CUT TO:  192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic EARMUFFS.  DREIBERG Okay, I\'m turning on the screamers.  We\'ll have to hit the roof running . . .  He throws a switch on the control panel.  193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT WINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH splits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop their weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as the Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .  194. INT. RORSCHACH\'S CELL - THAT MOMENT The LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH\'S FACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the wall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his TOILET.  Grunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its mounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is FLOODED.  195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER RAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.  RAFE Okay, boss, that oughta do it.  They give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER come gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.  LITTLE BIGGER WHAT THE --  RAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but there\'s no trace of RORSCHACH.  CARLOS Rorschach.  Company\'s calling . . .  RAFE Where is the fuckin\' runt?  CARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his fist.  196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT In answer to RAFE\'s question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door. He SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO\'s outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of the LOCK catches CARLO\'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .  . . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS, monkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide and an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.  CARLOS YOU\'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --  From the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor BETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --  -- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --  -- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do a herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --  -- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock DIM and DIE.  LITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down off his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies of the dead.  RORSCHACH Your move . . . runt.  The midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.  197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER DREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to get their bearings.  LAURIE Where are we?  What happened to the lights?  DREIBERG Generators\'ll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary . . .  Their heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND CORRIDOR crosses the one they\'re standing in.  As they watch, a SCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.  DREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a familiar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.  DREIBERG . . . Rorschach??  RORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second and a half -- then keeps on walking.  198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER The terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he\'s just hit a dead end.  He throws a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him. Desperate, he ducks into a MEN\'S ROOM.  RORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him, LAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross corridor.  LAURIE Rorschach!  Is that you??  He turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and dispassionate, he enters the MEN\'s room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand at the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.  LAURIE What\'s he doing?  DREIBERG I think he\'s going to the john.  LAURIE My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --  Before she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a paper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a ""howdy.""  DREIBERG . . . That was quick.  RORSCHACH Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd. (beat) Let\'s get out of here.  CUT TO:  199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT A well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky Mountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.  Air Force One is coming in for a landing.  200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER Lots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling about.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.  SECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and what looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal ramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON\'s in the passenger seat, and there\'s an imposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating a long stay.  PRESIDENT NIXON Hello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?  SECRETARY LIDDY She\'s all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right away.  LIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless corridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.  SECRETARY LIDDY (cont.) Weatherman says we\'re lookin\' good.  We\'ve got a fourteen-hour window.  PRESIDENT NIXON Fourteen hours, huh?  SECRETARY LIDDY Fourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.  CUT TO:  201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT LAURIE\'s following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen . . .  NEWSCASTER -- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place the one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --  . . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control console, occupied by other matters.  DREIBERG I don\'t know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.  RORSCHACH Veidt\'s a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.  DREIBERG What new information?  RORSCHACH Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . (scratching his chin)  Strange that no one\'s tried to attack you, Daniel.  There\'s an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG, highly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.  DREIBERG I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.  LAURIE Will you two lovebirds keep it down?  Still grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at the monitor LAURIE\'s watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the screen:  NEWSCASTER . . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was unavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the Antarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.  RORSCHACH ""Ozone layer""?  DREIBERG (rolling his eyes) Christ.  Couldn\'t he just admit that he\'s scared??  CUT TO:  202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT The last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of pristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous strip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered around what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is one.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT\'s Antarctic retreat.  203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT The entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian style as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad figure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered LYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him. One of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a silver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back of the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.  LACKEY Welcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.  VEIDT Feed Bubastis.  I\'ll have dinner when I\'ve looked in on the world.  They hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him to:  204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT The room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated REMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair, RED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.  VEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal a towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid, picking up transmissions from all over the world.  It\'s far more informational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp, a hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in and his eyes begin to rove.  205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL PANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials, sitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled ""LONDON."" VEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER\'S VOICE comes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense logo . . .  BBC NEWSCASTER -- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as possible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter can be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --  FLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT\'s gaze drifts several screens to the right, to the monitor labelled ""WASHINGTON D.C.""  Sound up:  NEWSCASTER -- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have already been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen insist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing negotiations --  FLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the bottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT\'s antarctic retreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new angle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are clear.  FLICK --  -- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we\'re watching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from twenty-some years ago; he\'s sitting at a table in the Gila Flas canteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he\'s getting ready to propose.  206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT eyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.  CUT TO:  207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT LOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds. On its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.  208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of the city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS, gradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It\'s been cordoned off, POLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.  DREIBERG They\'ve got my building surrounded. (looking up at her) They must\'ve been following you all along.  She stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.  DREIBERG (cont.) So much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.  LAURIE Welcome back, Night Owl.  DREIBERG What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?  RORSCHACH CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.  DREIBERG What do you mean, frame-up?  RORSCHACH Obvious pattern -- all ties in --  DREIBERG Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us? (spreading his hands) What about all those poor shits with cancer?  TIGHT ON LAURIE, who\'s listening to all this with mounting distress.  RORSCHACH How do we know they\'ve got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .  DREIBERG Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --  LAURIE (interrupting him) It\'s not.  RORSCHACH Not what?  LAURIE Not ""propaganda."" (pause; then, blurting it out --) Christ, I\'m one of them!  I\'ve got it.  DREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face bone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her grim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can think of anything to say.  Then RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the ""case,"" breaks the silence.  RORSCHACH Hnrrr -- changes everything.  Let\'s get moving.  209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT RORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily at a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers above.  210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.  LAURIE I should\'ve told you, Dan.  I\'m sorry.  I just wanted things between us to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --  DREIBERG It doesn\'t change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.  He tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up with tears.  LAURIE I love you too, Dan, I -- why don\'t you give me a minute to get myself together, okay?  211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP. RORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of satisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees DREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.  Above their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.  212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT LAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona resolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.  LAURIE Jon.  What are you doing here?  DR. MANHATTAN I\'m not here.  I\'m still on Mars.  I\'ve come to collect you.  LAURIE Collect me?  DR. MANHATTAN In the immediate future we\'re on Mars.  I\'m telling you goodbye. You\'re trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .  LAURIE Jon, no -- I can\'t --  DR. MANHATTAN It will happen, Laurie.  I\'ve already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.  DREIBERG\'s frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside the cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR. MANHATTAN\'s hand.  DREIBERG LAURIE!  DON\'T --  Hands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.  Stunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There\'s obviously nothing he can do.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.  RORSCHACH Where\'s Laurie?  DREIBERG I don\'t think she\'s coming with us.  DISSOLVE TO:  213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT A BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian surface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later LAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps, then GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red sands.  DR. MANHATTAN\'s gone several paces before he realizes there\'s a problem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at the air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back and extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by a HALO OF OXYGEN.  DR. MANHATTAN The atmosphere.  I\'m sorry.  These things slip my mind.  LAURIE Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --  Ignoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she stops in her tracks.  Before her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN\'s new abode: a PALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren sands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS, surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and pendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering crystalline castle.  DR. MANHATTAN I live here now.  He strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after him.  CUT TO:  214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT TIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the glow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.  RORSCHACH Heading south.  What\'s the plan?  DREIBERG We\'re running, Rorschach.  We\'ve got no place to go.  We\'re hightailing it down to Adrian\'s.  RORSCHACH Veidt\'s assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can\'t just --  DREIBERG (exploding) Cases, leads -- they don\'t matter, Rorschach.  The world\'s about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn\'t matter.  RORSCHACH Coward.  Giving up.  DREIBERG SHUT UP, Rorschach.  RORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.  RORSCHACH Sorry, Daniel.  You\'ve always been a good friend.  I know that. (pause) Sorry about Laurie.  DREIBERG (choked voice) Okay, let\'s just . . . thank you.  For a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can\'t leave well enough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.  RORSCHACH Veidt\'s not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.  CUT TO:  215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN\'S PALACE - NIGHT LAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals around the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING -- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.  LAURIE This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?  DR. MANHATTAN Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you\'ll tell me you\'re sleeping with Dreiberg.  LAURIE You -- you know about me and Dan?  He gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.  DR. MANHATTAN Time is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I\'ll finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.  LAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.  LAURIE Jon, does anybody know what the hell you\'re talking about? (flustered) Dan\'s just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he\'s seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.  DR. MANHATTAN (startled) Then you\'re sleeping with Dreiberg?  LAURIE Well, I just, you just said -- don\'t act surprised.  DR. MANHATTAN That\'s how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses. (nodding) We\'re all puppets.  I\'m just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.  She GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle of the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles below them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent WIND whips across their faces.  DR. MANHATTAN I\'ll be here for the next year or so.  Then I\'m going to work my way out toward the edge of the universe. (staring out at the landscape) Utterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn\'t it beautiful?  She moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and fissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and frightened.  LAURIE Jon -- there\'s something I have to know.  Did you love me once?  DR. MANHATTAN Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.  LAURIE Yet you must\'ve known all along that you\'d give me cancer.  Just be being with me.  DR. MANHATTAN I didn\'t give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don\'t know what did.  LAURIE But you knew that I\'d -- die.  DR. MANHATTAN Memories of the future are just like any others.  I\'ve tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . (pause) You won\'t die of cancer, Laurie.  There won\'t be time for that.  LAURIE\'s blood runs cold as she realizes what he\'s telling her.  LAURIE Then it\'s going to happen.  The world\'s going to end.  -- And you\'ve always known.  DR. MANHATTAN (nodding) Always.  Ever since the day I died.  He walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the forbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in her hands.  DR. MANHATTAN (cont.) Do you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it\'s been like for me these last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be destroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless agent of its destruction?  LAURIE (sobbing) Then why don\'t you . . . do something about it!  DR. MANHATTAN Because --  LAURIE Because you can\'t, I know, it\'s preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot. (angrily) Jon.  This, this ""script"" you\'re following . . . who writes it?  DR. MANHATTAN I don\'t know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.  That about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the shoulders:  LAURIE I can\'t stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I\'m going to die I want to be with -- other people.  DR. MANHATTAN Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I\'ve got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I\'ll be alone. (reaching for her hand) You\'re the last human being I\'ll ever see.  CUT TO:  216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT The OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south Atlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and begins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .  217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro. Finally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH\'s taken a bad tumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:  RORSCHACH What happened?  DREIBERG The guidance system\'s fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.  RORSCHACH What caused it?  DREIBERG Don\'t know.  Nothing I can think of -- (apprehensively) -- outside of a nuclear blast.  DISSOLVE TO:  218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT VEIDT\'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible through a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.  219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT VEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.  A second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.  220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT The OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.  221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT Through the cockpit, KARNAK¹s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it¹s lost in the snows again.  DREIBERG I¹m taking her down. (frantically throwing switches) Radar¹s blown.  I¹ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --  The SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.  222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.  A HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.  223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT VEIDT¹s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.  As he watches, the screens for ³LONDON² and ³PARIS² go WHITE.  224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER DREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN¹S VOICE announces:  VOICE Welcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.  DREIBERG Adrian!  It¹s Dreiberg.  For God¹s sake open the doors.  Nothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.  DREIBERG (cont.) Adrian!  We¹re freezing to death out here!  He slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.  RORSCHACH . . . He¹s not coming, Daniel.  225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT On the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.  The wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, ³PRAGUE² goes white.  226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT DREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.  DREIBERG Can¹t move . . . we¹re done for.  RORSCHACH Come on.  Found an exhaust vent.  RORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Veidt.  It¹s been Veidt all along.  He¹ll pay for this.  227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.  TWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.  VEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX growls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal\'s neck: quiet, girl.  RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN FLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening scene.  Suddenly . . .  RORSCHACH VEIDT!  VEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall; it catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG backs against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward him, TEETH BARED.  VEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a futuristic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along -- part of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.  DREIBERG Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn\'t you let us in?  RORSCHACH He\'s the one.  He\'s been the one all along.  Stalking us.  DREIBERG Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --  VEIDT Yeah.  See, I\'ve been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .  DREIBERG The missing scientists.  VEIDT Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.  RORSCHACH Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .  VEIDT Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we\'ll go save the world.  228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Gun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak. RORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping at his heels.  VEIDT Blake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers -- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn\'t Russia. (tapping his chest) It was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill him.  The rest of it -- Rorschach\'s capture, my ""assassination"" -- that was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting rid of Dr. Manhattan.  DREIBERG What??  VEIDT I couldn\'t let him interfere with my project.  RORSCHACH Veidt.  You\'re the one who started World War III.  VEIDT No.  I just hastened the inevitable. (smiling) He\'s been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.  DREIBERG Laurie?  You\'re responsible for --  VEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls out a smoke and strikes it against the box.  VEIDT (cont.) One thing I\'ve learned about cancer -- it\'s much easier to generate than it is to cure.  DREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the stun gun across DREIBERG\'s face, knocking him to the floor -- and LEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.  VEIDT Let\'s get something straight.  If you try that again, I\'ll kill you without a moment\'s thought.  They\'ve reached the entrance to VEIDT\'s information room.  200 SCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them inside.  RORSCHACH Call off the cat and I\'ll kill you, Veidt.  VEIDT Before you do that, you might want to look at what I\'ve been looking at.  229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand corner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila Flats, reassembling a WATCH.  DREIBERG What is this?  It looks like Jon.  VEIDT It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.  DREIBERG Good Lord.  How\'d you get it on tape?  VEIDT It\'s not on tape.  It\'s live.  We\'re watching it happen.  CUT TO:  230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN\'S PALACE - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him, LAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she\'s hit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On Mars.  DR. MANHATTAN I almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can\'t die.  It\'s a mystery I\'d like to penetrate.  LAURIE Jon, I do not want to hear it.  DR. MANHATTAN I\'m sorry.  Look -- there\'s a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .  LAURIE (shaking her head) Oh God.  I\'m no more than a bug on a windshield to you.  DR. MANHATTAN You\'re the only human being I care for.  LAURIE Then do me a favor.  If the world\'s going to end, it shouldn\'t matter a bit. (pause) I want you to cure me.  DR. MANHATTAN I won\'t do that.  LAURIE You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.  DR. MANHATTAN I explained this.  I can\'t.  That\'s not the way it happens.  LAURIE Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there\'s anything human left in you -- then do it.  Eyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her chest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.  Her fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR. MANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he\'s got to make the hardest decision of his life.  And then . . .  A BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN INTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian landscape altogether.  With a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see the figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great white VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the Martian desert gradually materialize around them.  The two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like statues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what\'s happened.  LAURIE What -- am I --  DR. MANHATTAN Cured, yes.  Utterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a handrail for support.  He looks like a man who\'s just had a heart attack.  LAURIE Jon, what is it?  What\'s the matter?  When he looks up at her, he\'s DESOLATE -- his face filled with DREAD.  DR. MANHATTAN Something. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It\'s all gone blank on me.  -- I can\'t remember the future.  Slowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around him.  LAURIE Jon.  Let\'s go back to Earth.  CUT TO:  231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT VEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F. room at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring machinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.  Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON OSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY\'s watch into its brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching him from twenty-four years in the future.  VEIDT Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes. (pause) Stand back from the field.  It\'ll blow you to bits.  DREIBERG What is it?  How does it work?  VEIDT It\'s a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time. (smiling) There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --  DREIBERG Adrian -- you\'ve lost it.  VEIDT (pointing at the tachyon bubble) I\'ve seen them!  I\'ve seen them in there. (pause)  In some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it survives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.  He draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.  VEIDT (cont.) The creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war. (wild-eyed) Do you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!  232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.  LAURIE We¹re too late.  DR. MANHATTAN It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .  LAURIE Jon -- what??  DR. MANHATTAN The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.  233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT Inside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.  VEIDT At first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.  He steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.  VEIDT It ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds. (turning to face them) In a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.  DREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.  RORSCHACH . . . And they call me a fucking nut.  DREIBERG Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.  VEIDT Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?  DREIBERG And what if you¹re wrong?  VEIDT I¹m not.  DREIBERG What if you¹re wrong??  VEIDT Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ! (shouting) I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!  234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.  DR. MANHATTAN That¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.  LAURIE Jon, where are we?  DR. MANHATTAN Veidt¹s complex.  235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT  Twenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:  VEIDT Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.  DREIBERG You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?  VEIDT We\'d better hope so.  -- It\'s almost time.  He kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum. Then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.  236. VEIDT\'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS In the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears a SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .  237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon bubble.  There\'s a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up --  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT\'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the trigger . . .  . . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM. VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .  . . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with LAURIE at his side.  DR. MANHATTAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?  VEIDT Jon!  Get back!  You don\'t understand.  DR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees himself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of the I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he\'s surprised.  In the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to sidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN THE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.  VEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE\'s directly in his path.  He shoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and points his STUN GUN directly at her --  -- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.  VEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --  VEIDT NO!!!!  -- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.  DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.  LAURIE What was he doing?  DREIBERG Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --  DR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.  DR. MANHATTAN He was right.  RORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.  DR. MANHATTAN He did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.  DR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.  LAURIE Jon --  DR. MANHATTAN Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.  LAURIE Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?  DR. MANHATTAN I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!  He lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz around his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the room dim; it\'s as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the world into his own massive frame.  DR. MANHATTAN My work here is finished . . .  The others cower.  They sense that something large is about to happen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the test chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the tiny hole in time.  He does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS into a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND STEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.  238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter bewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling gloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.  DR. MANHATTAN Don\'t be afraid, Jon.  I\'ll be here with you.  A second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps forward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.  For a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN\'s frame surrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR. MANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the chamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across the shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he spreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding FLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging with nothingness . . .  . . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue light dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he\'s alive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.  239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER The timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of his awed colleagues, who\'ve seen everything through the observation panel.  SCIENTIST What in the name of God . . .  The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY, sobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As she clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he looks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .  JON Your watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --  SCIENTIST II LOOK!!  The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber . . . which isn\'t there.  Instead, there\'s a rippling, irregular RUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are three odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH.  240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT\'S LAB - THE PRESENT DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the astounded SCIENTISTS.  LAURIE What happened -- ?  DREIBERG He saved himself.  He changed the past.  LAURIE Where did he go?  Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to THROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For a moment everything\'s back to normal --  -- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they\'re in begins to DISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.  A sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around them, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge into . . .  241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT DREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time could be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this would be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate; their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they know it, they find themselves deposited --  242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT -- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them materialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them, slamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the same, knocking over a fire hydrant.  LAURIE Dan, is this -- is this New York??  DREIBERG Those cars.  What year is this??  LAURIE Everything\'s changed --  It\'s a disorienting world they\'ve landed in.  In fact, it\'s our world, our New York, and everything -- the cars, the clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of whack . . .  RORSCHACH Hnrrrrr -- we never happened.  BYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of course, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden presence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers: Nuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?  RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too close, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to several dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection altogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a shrill WHISTLE.  DREIBERG Oh my God, they still ride around on horses!  243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT The same newsstand we\'ve seen all along -- but luckily, here in our world, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: ""RUSSIAN SUMMIT TALKS COLLAPSE.""  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR is gapin at the ruckus on the street.  NEWS VENDOR Jesus Christ, it must be Halloween.  His sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to the befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.  KID Shit, man!  It\'s Rorschach!  And Night Owl!  NEWS VENDOR What are you talkin\' about?  KID Superheroes!  Check it out!  He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR\'s hand and races off to join the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares down at the costumed characters in the comic book -- ""WATCHMEN"" -- then throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the street.  KID All right!  They must be on a case.  244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT HORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed with curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived to clear the streets and restore order.  COP I Break it up!  Stand back!  COP II Come on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --  DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle. They don\'t know what to expect and they\'re poised for a brawl.  The taunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant to advance.  LAURIE Dan -- what do we do now?  DREIBERG (panicked) Wherever we are, it\'s better than what we left.  Backs together --  LAURIE We\'ll tell them what\'s happened.  They\'ll listen to reason, won\'t they -- ?  RORSCHACH They\'d better.  And on RORSCHACH\'s final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and  FADE OUT.

She romanticized herself not as a great reformer but as the wife of a country physician. The realities of the doctor's household were colored by her pride.  Late at night, a step on the wooden porch, heard through her confusion of sleep; the storm-door opened; fumbling over the inner door-panels; the buzz of the electric bell. Kennicott muttering “Gol darn it,” but patiently creeping out of bed, remembering to draw the covers up to keep her warm, feeling for slippers and bathrobe, clumping down-stairs.  From below, half-heard in her drowsiness, a colloquy in the pidgin-German of the farmers who have forgotten the Old Country language without learning the new:  “Hello, Barney, wass willst du?”  “Morgen, doctor. Die Frau ist ja awful sick. All night she been having an awful pain in de belly.”  “How long she been this way? Wie lang, eh?”  “I dunno, maybe two days.”  “Why didn’t you come for me yesterday, instead of waking me up out of a sound sleep? Here it is two o'clock! So spat—warum, eh?”  “Nun aber, I know it, but she got soch a lot vorse last evening. I t'ought maybe all de time it go avay, but it got a lot vorse.”  “Any fever?”  “Vell ja, I t’ink she got fever.”  “Which side is the pain on?”  “Huh?”  “Das Schmertz—die Weh—which side is it on? Here?”  “So. Right here it is.”  “Any rigidity there?”  “Huh?”  “Is it rigid—stiff—I mean, does the belly feel hard to the fingers?”  “I dunno. She ain't said yet.”  “What she been eating?”  “Vell, I t'ink about vot ve alwis eat, maybe corn beef and cabbage and sausage, und so weiter. Doc, sie weint immer, all the time she holler like hell. I vish you come.”  “Well, all right, but you call me earlier, next time. Look here, Barney, you better install a 'phone—telephone haben. Some of you Dutchmen will be dying one of these days before you can fetch the doctor.”  The door closing. Barney's wagon—the wheels silent in the snow, but the wagon-body rattling. Kennicott clicking the receiver-hook to rouse the night telephone-operator, giving a number, waiting, cursing mildly, waiting again, and at last growling, “Hello, Gus, this is the doctor. Say, uh, send me up a team. Guess snow's too thick for a machine. Going eight miles south. All right. Huh? The hell I will! Don't you go back to sleep. Huh? Well, that's all right now, you didn’t wait so very darn long. All right, Gus; shoot her along. By!”  His step on the stairs; his quiet moving about the frigid room while he dressed; his abstracted and meaningless cough. She was supposed to be asleep; she was too exquisitely drowsy to break the charm by speaking. On a slip of paper laid on the bureau—she could hear the pencil grinding against the marble slab—he wrote his destination. He went out, hungry, chilly, unprotesting; and she, before she fell asleep again, loved him for his sturdiness, and saw the drama of his riding by night to the frightened household on the distant farm; pictured children standing at a window, waiting for him. He suddenly had in her eyes the heroism of a wireless operator on a ship in a collision; of an explorer, fever-clawed, deserted by his bearers, but going on—jungle—going——  At six, when the light faltered in as through ground glass and bleakly identified the chairs as gray rectangles, she heard his step on the porch; heard him at the furnace: the rattle of shaking the grate, the slow grinding removal of ashes, the shovel thrust into the coal-bin, the abrupt clatter of the coal as it flew into the fire-box, the fussy regulation of drafts—the daily sounds of a Gopher Prairie life, now first appealing to her as something brave and enduring, many-colored and free. She visioned the fire-box: flames turned to lemon and metallic gold as the coal-dust sifted over them; thin twisty flutters of purple, ghost flames which gave no light, slipping up between the dark banked coals.  It was luxurious in bed, and the house would be warm for her when she rose, she reflected. What a worthless cat she was! What were her aspirations beside his capability?  She awoke again as he dropped into bed.  “Seems just a few minutes ago that you started out!”  “I’ve been away four hours. I've operated a woman for appendicitis, in a Dutch kitchen. Came awful close to losing her, too, but I pulled her through all right. Close squeak. Barney says he shot ten rabbits last Sunday.”  He was instantly asleep—one hour of rest before he had to be up and ready for the farmers who came in early. She marveled that in what was to her but a night-blurred moment, he should have been in a distant place, have taken charge of a strange house, have slashed a woman, saved a life.  What wonder he detested the lazy Westlake and McGanum! How could the easy Guy Pollock understand this skill and endurance?  Then Kennicott was grumbling, “Seven-fifteen! Aren’t you ever going to get up for breakfast?” and he was not a hero-scientist but a rather irritable and commonplace man who needed a shave. They had coffee, griddle-cakes, and sausages, and talked about Mrs. McGanum's atrocious alligator-hide belt. Night witchery and morning disillusion were alike forgotten in the march of realities and days.  II  Familiar to the doctor's wife was the man with an injured leg, driven in from the country on a Sunday afternoon and brought to the house. He sat in a rocker in the back of a lumber-wagon, his face pale from the anguish of the jolting. His leg was thrust out before him, resting on a starch-box and covered with a leather-bound horse-blanket. His drab courageous wife drove the wagon, and she helped Kennicott support him as he hobbled up the steps, into the house.  “Fellow cut his leg with an ax—pretty bad gash—Halvor Nelson, nine miles out,” Kennicott observed.  Carol fluttered at the back of the room, childishly excited when she was sent to fetch towels and a basin of water. Kennicott lifted the farmer into a chair and chuckled, “There we are, Halvor! We'll have you out fixing fences and drinking aquavit in a month.” The farmwife sat on the couch, expressionless, bulky in a man’s dogskin coat and unplumbed layers of jackets. The flowery silk handkerchief which she had worn over her head now hung about her seamed neck. Her white wool gloves lay in her lap.  Kennicott drew from the injured leg the thick red “German sock,” the innumerous other socks of gray and white wool, then the spiral bandage. The leg was of an unwholesome dead white, with the black hairs feeble and thin and flattened, and the scar a puckered line of crimson. Surely, Carol shuddered, this was not human flesh, the rosy shining tissue of the amorous poets.  Kennicott examined the scar, smiled at Halvor and his wife, chanted, “Fine, b' gosh! Couldn't be better!”  The Nelsons looked deprecating. The farmer nodded a cue to his wife and she mourned:  “Vell, how much ve going to owe you, doctor?”  “I guess it'll be——Let's see: one drive out and two calls. I guess it'll be about eleven dollars in all, Lena.”  “I dunno ve can pay you yoost a little w'ile, doctor.”  Kennicott lumbered over to her, patted her shoulder, roared, “Why, Lord love you, sister, I won't worry if I never get it! You pay me next fall, when you get your crop. . . . Carrie! Suppose you or Bea could shake up a cup of coffee and some cold lamb for the Nelsons? They got a long cold drive ahead.”  III  He had been gone since morning; her eyes ached with reading; Vida Sherwin could not come to tea. She wandered through the house, empty as the bleary street without. The problem of “Will the doctor be home in time for supper, or shall I sit down without him?” was important in the household. Six was the rigid, the canonical supper-hour, but at half-past six he had not come. Much speculation with Bea: Had the obstetrical case taken longer than he had expected? Had he been called somewhere else? Was the snow much heavier out in the country, so that he should have taken a buggy, or even a cutter, instead of the car? Here in town it had melted a lot, but still——  A honking, a shout, the motor engine raced before it was shut off.  She hurried to the window. The car was a monster at rest after furious adventures. The headlights blazed on the clots of ice in the road so that the tiniest lumps gave mountainous shadows, and the taillight cast a circle of ruby on the snow behind. Kennicott was opening the door, crying, “Here we are, old girl! Got stuck couple times, but we made it, by golly, we made it, and here we be! Come on! Food! Eatin's!”  She rushed to him, patted his fur coat, the long hairs smooth but chilly to her fingers. She joyously summoned Bea, “All right! He's here! We'll sit right down!”  IV  There were, to inform the doctor's wife of his successes no clapping audiences nor book-reviews nor honorary degrees. But there was a letter written by a German farmer recently moved from Minnesota to Saskatchewan:  Dear sor, as you haf bin treading mee for a fue Weaks dis Somer and seen wat is rong wit mee so in Regarding to dat i wont to tank you. the Doctor heir say wat shot bee rong wit mee and day give mee som Madsin but it diten halp mee like wat you dit.

Well i haven ben tacking aney ting for about one & 1/2 Mont but i dont get better so i like to heir Wat you tink about it i feel like dis Disconfebil feeling around the Stomac after eating and dat Pain around Heard and down the arm and about 3 to 3 1/2 Hour after Eating i feel weeak like and dissy and a dull Hadig. Now you gust lett mee know Wat you tink about mee, i do Wat you say.  V  She encountered Guy Pollock at the drug store. He looked at her as though he had a right to; he spoke softly. “I haven't see you, the last few days.”  “No. I've been out in the country with Will several times. He's so——Do you know that people like you and me can never understand people like him? We're a pair of hypercritical loafers, you and I, while he quietly goes and does things.”  She nodded and smiled and was very busy about purchasing boric acid. He stared after her, and slipped away.  When she found that he was gone she was slightly disconcerted.  VI  She could—at times—agree with Kennicott that the shaving-and-corsets familiarity of married life was not dreary vulgarity but a wholesome frankness; that artificial reticences might merely be irritating. She was not much disturbed when for hours he sat about the living-room in his honest socks. But she would not listen to his theory that “all this romance stuff is simply moonshine—elegant when you're courting, but no use busting yourself keeping it up all your life.”  She thought of surprises, games, to vary the days. She knitted an astounding purple scarf, which she hid under his supper plate. (When he discovered it he looked embarrassed, and gasped, “Is today an anniversary or something? Gosh, I'd forgotten it!”)  Once she filled a thermos bottle with hot coffee a corn-flakes box with cookies just baked by Bea, and bustled to his office at three in the afternoon. She hid her bundles in the hall and peeped in.  The office was shabby. Kennicott had inherited it from a medical predecessor, and changed it only by adding a white enameled operating-table, a sterilizer, a Roentgen-ray apparatus, and a small portable typewriter. It was a suite of two rooms: a waiting-room with straight chairs, shaky pine table, and those coverless and unknown magazines which are found only in the offices of dentists and doctors. The room beyond, looking on Main Street, was business-office, consulting-room, operating-room, and, in an alcove, bacteriological and chemical laboratory. The wooden floors of both rooms were bare; the furniture was brown and scaly.  Waiting for the doctor were two women, as still as though they were paralyzed, and a man in a railroad brakeman's uniform, holding his bandaged right hand with his tanned left. They stared at Carol. She sat modestly in a stiff chair, feeling frivolous and out of place.  Kennicott appeared at the inner door, ushering out a bleached man with a trickle of wan beard, and consoling him, “All right, Dad. Be careful about the sugar, and mind the diet I gave you. Gut the prescription filled, and come in and see me next week. Say, uh, better, uh, better not drink too much beer. All right, Dad.”  His voice was artificially hearty. He looked absently at Carol. He was a medical machine now, not a domestic machine. “What is it, Carrie?” he droned.  “No hurry. Just wanted to say hello.”  “Well——”  Self-pity because he did not divine that this was a surprise party rendered her sad and interesting to herself, and she had the pleasure of the martyrs in saying bravely to him, “It's nothing special. If you're busy long I'll trot home.”  While she waited she ceased to pity and began to mock herself. For the first time she observed the waiting-room. Oh yes, the doctor's family had to have obi panels and a wide couch and an electric percolator, but any hole was good enough for sick tired common people who were nothing but the one means and excuse for the doctor's existing! No. She couldn't blame Kennicott. He was satisfied by the shabby chairs. He put up with them as his patients did. It was her neglected province—she who had been going about talking of rebuilding the whole town!  When the patients were gone she brought in her bundles.  “What's those?” wondered Kennicott.  “Turn your back! Look out of the window!”  He obeyed—not very much bored. When she cried “Now!” a feast of cookies and small hard candies and hot coffee was spread on the roll-top desk in the inner room.  His broad face lightened. “That's a new one on me! Never was more surprised in my life! And, by golly, I believe I am hungry. Say, this is fine.”  When the first exhilaration of the surprise had declined she demanded, “Will! I'm going to refurnish your waiting-room!”  “What's the matter with it? It's all right.”  “It is not! It's hideous. We can afford to give your patients a better place. And it would be good business.” She felt tremendously politic.  “Rats! I don't worry about the business. You look here now: As I told you——Just because I like to tuck a few dollars away, I'll be switched if I'll stand for your thinking I'm nothing but a dollar-chasing——”  “Stop it! Quick! I'm not hurting your feelings! I'm not criticizing! I'm the adoring least one of thy harem. I just mean——”  Two days later, with pictures, wicker chairs, a rug, she had made the waiting-room habitable; and Kennicott admitted, “Does look a lot better. Never thought much about it. Guess I need being bullied.”  She was convinced that she was gloriously content in her career as doctor's-wife.  VII  She tried to free herself from the speculation and disillusionment which had been twitching at her; sought to dismiss all the opinionation of an insurgent era. She wanted to shine upon the veal-faced bristly-bearded Lyman Cass as much as upon Miles Bjornstam or Guy Pollock. She gave a reception for the Thanatopsis Club. But her real acquiring of merit was in calling upon that Mrs. Bogart whose gossipy good opinion was so valuable to a doctor.  Though the Bogart house was next door she had entered it but three times. Now she put on her new moleskin cap, which made her face small and innocent, she rubbed off the traces of a lip-stick—and fled across the alley before her admirable resolution should sneak away.  The age of houses, like the age of men, has small relation to their years. The dull-green cottage of the good Widow Bogart was twenty years old, but it had the antiquity of Cheops, and the smell of mummy-dust. Its neatness rebuked the street. The two stones by the path were painted yellow; the outhouse was so overmodestly masked with vines and lattice that it was not concealed at all; the last iron dog remaining in Gopher Prairie stood among whitewashed conch-shells upon the lawn. The hallway was dismayingly scrubbed; the kitchen was an exercise in mathematics, with problems worked out in equidistant chairs.  The parlor was kept for visitors. Carol suggested, “Let's sit in the kitchen. Please don't trouble to light the parlor stove.”  “No trouble at all! My gracious, and you coming so seldom and all, and the kitchen is a perfect sight, I try to keep it clean, but Cy will track mud all over it, I've spoken to him about it a hundred times if I've spoken once, no, you sit right there, dearie, and I'll make a fire, no trouble at all, practically no trouble at all.”  Mrs. Bogart groaned, rubbed her joints, and repeatedly dusted her hands while she made the fire, and when Carol tried to help she lamented, “Oh, it doesn't matter; guess I ain't good for much but toil and workin' anyway; seems as though that's what a lot of folks think.”  The parlor was distinguished by an expanse of rag carpet from which, as they entered, Mrs. Bogart hastily picked one sad dead fly. In the center of the carpet was a rug depicting a red Newfoundland dog, reclining in a green and yellow daisy field and labeled “Our Friend.” The parlor organ, tall and thin, was adorned with a mirror partly circular, partly square, and partly diamond-shaped, and with brackets holding a pot of geraniums, a mouth-organ, and a copy of “The Oldtime Hymnal.” On the center table was a Sears-Roebuck mail-order catalogue, a silver frame with photographs of the Baptist Church and of an elderly clergyman, and an aluminum tray containing a rattlesnake's rattle and a broken spectacle-lens.  Mrs. Bogart spoke of the eloquence of the Reverend Mr. Zitterel, the coldness of cold days, the price of poplar wood, Dave Dyer's new hair-cut, and Cy Bogart's essential piety. “As I said to his Sunday School teacher, Cy may be a little wild, but that's because he's got so much better brains than a lot of these boys, and this farmer that claims he caught Cy stealing 'beggies, is a liar, and I ought to have the law on him.”  Mrs. Bogart went thoroughly into the rumor that the girl waiter at Billy's Lunch was not all she might be—or, rather, was quite all she might be.  “My lands, what can you expect when everybody knows what her mother was? And if these traveling salesmen would let her alone she would be all right, though I certainly don't believe she ought to be allowed to think she can pull the wool over our eyes. The sooner she's sent to the school for incorrigible girls down at Sauk Centre, the better for all and——Won't you just have a cup of coffee, Carol dearie, I'm sure you won't mind old Aunty Bogart calling you by your first name when you think how long I've known Will, and I was such a friend of his dear lovely mother when she lived here and—was that fur cap expensive? But——Don't you think it's awful, the way folks talk in this town?”  Mrs. Bogart hitched her chair nearer. Her large face, with its disturbing collection of moles and lone black hairs, wrinkled cunningly. She showed her decayed teeth in a reproving smile, and in the confidential voice of one who scents stale bedroom scandal she breathed:  “I just don't see how folks can talk and act like they do. You don't know the things that go on under cover. This town—why it's only the religious training I've given Cy that's kept him so innocent of—things. Just the other day——I never pay no attention to stories, but I heard it mighty good and straight that Harry Haydock is carrying on with a girl that clerks in a store down in Minneapolis, and poor Juanita not knowing anything about it—though maybe it's the judgment of God, because before she married Harry she acted up with more than one boy——Well, I don't like to say it, and maybe I ain't up-to-date, like Cy says, but I always believed a lady shouldn't even give names to all sorts of dreadful things, but just the same I know there was at least one case where Juanita and a boy—well, they were just dreadful. And—and——Then there's that Ole Jenson the grocer, that thinks he's so plaguey smart, and I know he made up to a farmer's wife and——And this awful man Bjornstam that does chores, and Nat Hicks and——”  There was, it seemed, no person in town who was not living a life of shame except Mrs. Bogart, and naturally she resented it.  She knew. She had always happened to be there. Once, she whispered, she was going by when an indiscreet window-shade had been left up a couple of inches. Once she had noticed a man and woman holding hands, and right at a Methodist sociable!  “Another thing——Heaven knows I never want to start trouble, but I can't help what I see from my back steps, and I notice your hired girl Bea carrying on with the grocery boys and all——”  “Mrs. Bogart! I'd trust Bea as I would myself!”  “Oh, dearie, you don't understand me! I'm sure she's a good girl. I mean she's green, and I hope that none of these horrid young men that there are around town will get her into trouble! It's their parents' fault, letting them run wild and hear evil things. If I had my way there wouldn't be none of them, not boys nor girls neither, allowed to know anything about—about things till they was married. It's terrible the bald way that some folks talk. It just shows and gives away what awful thoughts they got inside them, and there's nothing can cure them except coming right to God and kneeling down like I do at prayer-meeting every Wednesday evening, and saying, 'O God, I would be a miserable sinner except for thy grace.'  “I'd make every last one of these brats go to Sunday School and learn to think about nice things 'stead of about cigarettes and goings-on—and these dances they have at the lodges are the worst thing that ever happened to this town, lot of young men squeezing girls and finding out——Oh, it's dreadful. I've told the mayor he ought to put a stop to them and——There was one boy in this town, I don't want to be suspicious or uncharitable but——”  It was half an hour before Carol escaped.  She stopped on her own porch and thought viciously:  “If that woman is on the side of the angels, then I have no choice; I must be on the side of the devil. But—isn't she like me? She too wants to 'reform the town'! She too criticizes everybody! She too thinks the men are vulgar and limited! AM I LIKE HER? This is ghastly!”  That evening she did not merely consent to play cribbage with Kennicott; she urged him to play; and she worked up a hectic interest in land-deals and Sam Clark.  VIII  In courtship days Kennicott had shown her a photograph of Nels Erdstrom's baby and log cabin, but she had never seen the Erdstroms. They had become merely “patients of the doctor.” Kennicott telephoned her on a mid-December afternoon, “Want to throw your coat on and drive out to Erdstrom's with me? Fairly warm. Nels got the jaundice.”  “Oh yes!” She hastened to put on woolen stockings, high boots, sweater, muffler, cap, mittens.  The snow was too thick and the ruts frozen too hard for the motor. They drove out in a clumsy high carriage. Tucked over them was a blue woolen cover, prickly to her wrists, and outside of it a buffalo robe, humble and moth-eaten now, used ever since the bison herds had streaked the prairie a few miles to the west.  The scattered houses between which they passed in town were small and desolate in contrast to the expanse of huge snowy yards and wide street. They crossed the railroad tracks, and instantly were in the farm country. The big piebald horses snorted clouds of steam, and started to trot. The carriage squeaked in rhythm. Kennicott drove with clucks of “There boy, take it easy!” He was thinking. He paid no attention to Carol. Yet it was he who commented, “Pretty nice, over there,” as they approached an oak-grove where shifty winter sunlight quivered in the hollow between two snow-drifts.  They drove from the natural prairie to a cleared district which twenty years ago had been forest. The country seemed to stretch unchanging to the North Pole: low hill, brush-scraggly bottom, reedy creek, muskrat mound, fields with frozen brown clods thrust up through the snow.  Her ears and nose were pinched; her breath frosted her collar; her fingers ached.  “Getting colder,” she said.  “Yup.”  That was all their conversation for three miles. Yet she was happy.  They reached Nels Erdstrom's at four, and with a throb she recognized the courageous venture which had lured her to Gopher Prairie: the cleared fields, furrows among stumps, a log cabin chinked with mud and roofed with dry hay. But Nels had prospered. He used the log cabin as a barn; and a new house reared up, a proud, unwise, Gopher Prairie house, the more naked and ungraceful in its glossy white paint and pink trimmings. Every tree had been cut down. The house was so unsheltered, so battered by the wind, so bleakly thrust out into the harsh clearing, that Carol shivered. But they were welcomed warmly enough in the kitchen, with its crisp new plaster, its black and nickel range, its cream separator in a corner.  Mrs. Erdstrom begged her to sit in the parlor, where there was a phonograph and an oak and leather davenport, the prairie farmer's proofs of social progress, but she dropped down by the kitchen stove and insisted, “Please don't mind me.” When Mrs. Erdstrom had followed the doctor out of the room Carol glanced in a friendly way at the grained pine cupboard, the framed Lutheran Konfirmations Attest, the traces of fried eggs and sausages on the dining table against the wall, and a jewel among calendars, presenting not only a lithographic young woman with cherry lips, and a Swedish advertisement of Axel Egge's grocery, but also a thermometer and a match-holder.  She saw that a boy of four or five was staring at her from the hall, a boy in gingham shirt and faded corduroy trousers, but large-eyed, firm-mouthed, wide-browed. He vanished, then peeped in again, biting his knuckles, turning his shoulder toward her in shyness.  Didn't she remember—what was it?—Kennicott sitting beside her at Fort Snelling, urging, “See how scared that baby is. Needs some woman like you.”  Magic had fluttered about her then—magic of sunset and cool air and the curiosity of lovers. She held out her hands as much to that sanctity as to the boy.  He edged into the room, doubtfully sucking his thumb.  “Hello,” she said. “What's your name?”  “Hee, hee, hee!”  “You're quite right. I agree with you. Silly people like me always ask children their names.”  “Hee, hee, hee!”  “Come here and I'll tell you the story of—well, I don't know what it will be about, but it will have a slim heroine and a Prince Charming.”  He stood stoically while she spun nonsense. His giggling ceased. She was winning him. Then the telephone bell—two long rings, one short.  Mrs. Erdstrom galloped into the room, shrieked into the transmitter, “Vell? Yes, yes, dis is Erdstrom's place! Heh? Oh, you vant de doctor?”  Kennicott appeared, growled into the telephone:  “Well, what do you want? Oh, hello Dave; what do you want? Which Morgenroth's? Adolph's? All right. Amputation? Yuh, I see. Say, Dave, get Gus to harness up and take my surgical kit down there—and have him take some chloroform. I'll go straight down from here. May not get home tonight. You can get me at Adolph's. Huh? No, Carrie can give the anesthetic, I guess. G'-by. Huh? No; tell me about that tomorrow—too damn many people always listening in on this farmers' line.”  He turned to Carol. “Adolph Morgenroth, farmer ten miles southwest of town, got his arm crushed-fixing his cow-shed and a post caved in on him—smashed him up pretty bad—may have to amputate, Dave Dyer says. Afraid we'll have to go right from here. Darn sorry to drag you clear down there with me——”  “Please do. Don't mind me a bit.”  “Think you could give the anesthetic? Usually have my driver do it.”  “If you'll tell me how.”  “All right. Say, did you hear me putting one over on these goats that are always rubbering in on party-wires? I hope they heard me! Well. . . . Now, Bessie, don't you worry about Nels. He's getting along all right. Tomorrow you or one of the neighbors drive in and get this prescription filled at Dyer's. Give him a teaspoonful every four hours. Good-by. Hel-lo! Here's the little fellow! My Lord, Bessie, it ain't possible this is the fellow that used to be so sickly? Why, say, he's a great big strapping Svenska now—going to be bigger 'n his daddy!”  Kennicott's bluffness made the child squirm with a delight which Carol could not evoke. It was a humble wife who followed the busy doctor out to the carriage, and her ambition was not to play Rachmaninoff better, nor to build town halls, but to chuckle at babies.  The sunset was merely a flush of rose on a dome of silver, with oak twigs and thin poplar branches against it, but a silo on the horizon changed from a red tank to a tower of violet misted over with gray. The purple road vanished, and without lights, in the darkness of a world destroyed, they swayed on—toward nothing.  It was a bumpy cold way to the Morgenroth farm, and she was asleep when they arrived.  Here was no glaring new house with a proud phonograph, but a low whitewashed kitchen smelling of cream and cabbage. Adolph Morgenroth was lying on a couch in the rarely used dining-room. His heavy work-scarred wife was shaking her hands in anxiety.  Carol felt that Kennicott would do something magnificent and startling. But he was casual. He greeted the man, “Well, well, Adolph, have to fix you up, eh?” Quietly, to the wife, “Hat die drug store my schwartze bag hier geschickt? So—schon. Wie viel Uhr ist 's? Sieben? Nun, lassen uns ein wenig supper zuerst haben. Got any of that good beer left—giebt 's noch Bier?”  He had supped in four minutes. His coat off, his sleeves rolled up, he was scrubbing his hands in a tin basin in the sink, using the bar of yellow kitchen soap.  Carol had not dared to look into the farther room while she labored over the supper of beer, rye bread, moist cornbeef and cabbage, set on the kitchen table. The man in there was groaning. In her one glance she had seen that his blue flannel shirt was open at a corded tobacco-brown neck, the hollows of which were sprinkled with thin black and gray hairs. He was covered with a sheet, like a corpse, and outside the sheet was his right arm, wrapped in towels stained with blood.  But Kennicott strode into the other room gaily, and she followed him. With surprising delicacy in his large fingers he unwrapped the towels and revealed an arm which, below the elbow, was a mass of blood and raw flesh. The man bellowed. The room grew thick about her; she was very seasick; she fled to a chair in the kitchen. Through the haze of nausea she heard Kennicott grumbling, “Afraid it will have to come off, Adolph. What did you do? Fall on a reaper blade? We'll fix it right up. Carrie! CAROL!”  She couldn't—she couldn't get up. Then she was up, her knees like water, her stomach revolving a thousand times a second, her eyes filmed, her ears full of roaring. She couldn't reach the dining-room. She was going to faint. Then she was in the dining-room, leaning against the wall, trying to smile, flushing hot and cold along her chest and sides, while Kennicott mumbled, “Say, help Mrs. Morgenroth and me carry him in on the kitchen table. No, first go out and shove those two tables together, and put a blanket on them and a clean sheet.”  It was salvation to push the heavy tables, to scrub them, to be exact in placing the sheet. Her head cleared; she was able to look calmly in at her husband and the farmwife while they undressed the wailing man, got him into a clean nightgown, and washed his arm. Kennicott came to lay out his instruments. She realized that, with no hospital facilities, yet with no worry about it, her husband—HER HUSBAND—was going to perform a surgical operation, that miraculous boldness of which one read in stories about famous surgeons.  She helped them to move Adolph into the kitchen. The man was in such a funk that he would not use his legs. He was heavy, and smelled of sweat and the stable. But she put her arm about his waist, her sleek head by his chest; she tugged at him; she clicked her tongue in imitation of Kennicott's cheerful noises.  When Adolph was on the table Kennicott laid a hemispheric steel and cotton frame on his face; suggested to Carol, “Now you sit here at his head and keep the ether dripping—about this fast, see? I'll watch his breathing. Look who's here! Real anesthetist! Ochsner hasn't got a better one! Class, eh? . . . Now, now, Adolph, take it easy. This won't hurt you a bit. Put you all nice and asleep and it won't hurt a bit. Schweig' mal! Bald schlaft man grat wie ein Kind. So! So! Bald geht's besser!”  As she let the ether drip, nervously trying to keep the rhythm that Kennicott had indicated, Carol stared at her husband with the abandon of hero-worship.  He shook his head. “Bad light—bad light. Here, Mrs. Morgenroth, you stand right here and hold this lamp. Hier, und dieses—dieses lamp halten—so!”  By that streaky glimmer he worked, swiftly, at ease. The room was still. Carol tried to look at him, yet not look at the seeping blood, the crimson slash, the vicious scalpel. The ether fumes were sweet, choking. Her head seemed to be floating away from her body. Her arm was feeble.  It was not the blood but the grating of the surgical saw on the living bone that broke her, and she knew that she had been fighting off nausea, that she was beaten. She was lost in dizziness. She heard Kennicott's voice—  “Sick? Trot outdoors couple minutes. Adolph will stay under now.”  She was fumbling at a door-knob which whirled in insulting circles; she was on the stoop, gasping, forcing air into her chest, her head clearing. As she returned she caught the scene as a whole: the cavernous kitchen, two milk-cans a leaden patch by the wall, hams dangling from a beam, bats of light at the stove door, and in the center, illuminated by a small glass lamp held by a frightened stout woman, Dr. Kennicott bending over a body which was humped under a sheet—the surgeon, his bare arms daubed with blood, his hands, in pale-yellow rubber gloves, loosening the tourniquet, his face without emotion save when he threw up his head and clucked at the farmwife, “Hold that light steady just a second more—noch blos esn wenig.”  “He speaks a vulgar, common, incorrect German of life and death and birth and the soil. I read the French and German of sentimental lovers and Christmas garlands. And I thought that it was I who had the culture!” she worshiped as she returned to her place.  After a time he snapped, “That's enough. Don't give him any more ether.” He was concentrated on tying an artery. His gruffness seemed heroic to her.  As he shaped the flap of flesh she murmured, “Oh, you ARE wonderful!”  He was surprised. “Why, this is a cinch. Now if it had been like last week——Get me some more water. Now last week I had a case with an ooze in the peritoneal cavity, and by golly if it wasn't a stomach ulcer that I hadn't suspected and——There. Say, I certainly am sleepy. Let's turn in here. Too late to drive home. And tastes to me like a storm coming.”  IX  They slept on a feather bed with their fur coats over them; in the morning they broke ice in the pitcher—the vast flowered and gilt pitcher.  Kennicott's storm had not come. When they set out it was hazy and growing warmer. After a mile she saw that he was studying a dark cloud in the north. He urged the horses to the run. But she forgot his unusual haste in wonder at the tragic landscape. The pale snow, the prickles of old stubble, and the clumps of ragged brush faded into a gray obscurity. Under the hillocks were cold shadows. The willows about a farmhouse were agitated by the rising wind, and the patches of bare wood where the bark had peeled away were white as the flesh of a leper. The snowy slews were of a harsh flatness. The whole land was cruel, and a climbing cloud of slate-edged blackness dominated the sky.  “Guess we're about in for a blizzard,” speculated Kennicott “We can make Ben McGonegal's, anyway.”  “Blizzard? Really? Why——But still we used to think they were fun when I was a girl. Daddy had to stay home from court, and we'd stand at the window and watch the snow.”  “Not much fun on the prairie. Get lost. Freeze to death. Take no chances.” He chirruped at the horses. They were flying now, the carriage rocking on the hard ruts.  The whole air suddenly crystallized into large damp flakes. The horses and the buffalo robe were covered with snow; her face was wet; the thin butt of the whip held a white ridge. The air became colder. The snowflakes were harder; they shot in level lines, clawing at her face.  She could not see a hundred feet ahead.  Kennicott was stern. He bent forward, the reins firm in his coonskin gauntlets. She was certain that he would get through. He always got through things.  Save for his presence, the world and all normal living disappeared. They were lost in the boiling snow. He leaned close to bawl, “Letting the horses have their heads. They'll get us home.”  With a terrifying bump they were off the road, slanting with two wheels in the ditch, but instantly they were jerked back as the horses fled on. She gasped. She tried to, and did not, feel brave as she pulled the woolen robe up about her chin.  They were passing something like a dark wall on the right. “I know that barn!” he yelped. He pulled at the reins. Peeping from the covers she saw his teeth pinch his lower lip, saw him scowl as he slackened and sawed and jerked sharply again at the racing horses.  They stopped.  “Farmhouse there. Put robe around you and come on,” he cried.  It was like diving into icy water to climb out of the carriage, but on the ground she smiled at him, her face little and childish and pink above the buffalo robe over her shoulders. In a swirl of flakes which scratched at their eyes like a maniac darkness, he unbuckled the harness. He turned and plodded back, a ponderous furry figure, holding the horses' bridles, Carol's hand dragging at his sleeve.  They came to the cloudy bulk of a barn whose outer wall was directly upon the road. Feeling along it, he found a gate, led them into a yard, into the barn. The interior was warm. It stunned them with its languid quiet.  He carefully drove the horses into stalls.  Her toes were coals of pain. “Let's run for the house,” she said.  “Can't. Not yet. Might never find it. Might get lost ten feet away from it. Sit over in this stall, near the horses. We'll rush for the house when the blizzard lifts.”  “I'm so stiff! I can't walk!”  He carried her into the stall, stripped off her overshoes and boots, stopping to blow on his purple fingers as he fumbled at her laces. He rubbed her feet, and covered her with the buffalo robe and horse-blankets from the pile on the feed-box. She was drowsy, hemmed in by the storm. She sighed:  “You're so strong and yet so skilful and not afraid of blood or storm or——”  “Used to it. Only thing that's bothered me was the chance the ether fumes might explode, last night.”  “I don't understand.”  “Why, Dave, the darn fool, sent me ether, instead of chloroform like I told him, and you know ether fumes are mighty inflammable, especially with that lamp right by the table. But I had to operate, of course—wound chuck-full of barnyard filth that way.”  “You knew all the time that——Both you and I might have been blown up? You knew it while you were operating?”  “Sure. Didn't you? Why, what's the matter?”"", ' Hung my cotton dress on rusted wire Up there on Pilahatchee Bridge Just a crazy roughneck\'s daughter Jumped head-first into the water Baptized away my sins Hitched to town with Bobby Jo and Tommy Couple of lookers, new best friends We slipped in the back of Sunday service Know them church ladies, they heard us Bum smoke money from the offering   Mama said, ""Idle hands are Devil\'s handiwork Oh, the trouble you\'ll get into You got nothin\' better to do, got nothin\' better to do You got nothin\' better to do, got nothin\' better to do"" Yeah!

I felt like I had nothing to say. I still feel I have nothing to say. I’m the most boring person to talk to.  So why now? Is your label pushing you to do press for the album? No, labels always push. I mean, Trilogy was a rerelease, but they still said, “Maybe you should do some interviews.” Honestly, I want to do interviews now because it’s one thing that I haven’t mastered. Even Prince did interviews. Michael did interviews. And I can tell in the interviews they’re uncomfortable. Why are they doing this? Because they feel like they have to do it to be a complete artist. I felt like this was my time. And maybe I wouldn’t have done it if I thought you were an asshole. I probably would have been like, “Fuck this guy.”  Is the air of mystery intentional? Yes and no. In the beginning, I was very insecure. I hated how I looked in pictures. I just fucking hated this shit, like, crop me out of this picture right now. I was very camera shy. People like hot girls, so I put my music to hot girls and it just became a trend. The whole “enigmatic artist” thing, I just ran with it. No one could find pictures of me. It reminded me of some villain shit. But you can’t escape the Internet. There are super fans, and I was really testing their patience. At the end of the day you can’t deny the music. That was my whole thing: I’m going to let the music speak for itself. I’ll show them that this is what I do. But I’m very good at letting shit slide. If I wasn’t…  —you’d go crazy. I feel like I’m already crazy. I just wouldn’t be able to focus on my music. If I didn’t let shit slide, I’d probably still be working on Echoes of Silence right now. But, I know how to let go of bullshit. And I know how to let go of unmixed and unmastered records. But not anymore. To me, this is my first album. Kiss Land is definitely my first album.  A fresh start. Yeah, that’s why I didn’t want to mix and master House of Balloons or Thursday or Echoes of Silence. I didn’t feel like they were my albums. Those were my mixtapes.  It was a hell of a mixtape. Yeah, man. I just wanted to make the greatest mixtape of all time, that’s all. And if I didn’t, I definitely made the longest mixtape of all time.   Which of the three resonates with you the most? House of Balloons is the most important for me because I spent the most time on it. I didn’t have a deadline for that. As soon as I put House of Balloons out, I let the world know I’m coming out with two more albums this year, so I had my own little deadline. Before House of Balloons, it was all freedom.  House of Balloons was actually supposed to have more songs than it does. I had so many records left, and then Take Care came through. “Crew Love,” “Shot for Me,” and “The Ride” were supposed to be on House of Balloons. I wanted to come out with like 14 records. I felt like “The Ride” was the last one, and it wasn’t done yet.  heard it and he was like, “This shit’s crazy.”  How did you give it to him? Was it just an instrumental? Yeah, we were making the drum loop and...oh, man, I had smoked I don’t know how much weed. Even Drake, he came into that session and we were all smoked out. It was terrible how much weed smoke was in that room. I was surprised I could even hit a note. I had sung this melody—it wasn’t a hook, just an unfinished lyric. And he liked it so much, he was like, “I need to have this, man.... I know I’ve already taken ‘Shot for Me’ and ‘Crew Love’ and this and that.” And me, I was hungry at that time. I was like, “Dude, take anything.” At that point I was like, “Hell, yeah.”  In your mind, what was “The Ride” supposed to be? There are two ways of making music for me. There’s a calculated route—like, I know exactly what I’m going to do with this song. And then there’s the free mind. That was one of the free-minded records. It was all subconscious. I’ll make the music first and loop it, and then I’ll go into the booth and start singing almost 45 minutes straight. And these are not words; this is gibberish. It’s a songwriter language. There are lyrics on Thursday, I don’t even know what the fuck I said. “Gone” was a complete freestyle.  Isn’t that like eight minutes long?  Yeah, exactly. With me, everything is a blank canvas. I’m painting this canvas by whipping the colors. I want to show the world that I can shit out albums like nothing.  The song “Kiss Land” has a new level of musicality and thoughtfulness that seems apropos for your first major label release. I’m all about evolution. I’m the first person to judge myself. I listen to my music and I’ll be like, “This is shit.” Everyone around me is like, “What the fuck is wrong with you?”  What are some flaws you saw in your past three releases? Just technical, musical stuff. And, of course, writing. You’re bound to find flaws and repetition when you come out with three albums in one year. At that point I was very cavalier; I didn’t give a shit. Some people realize it and some don’t. Me, I’m very critical.  I’m not here to change or lie about what I’m going to do. What I sing about is what I sing about. But there’s a lot of cool twists with this album, because this album symbolizes everything that I’d never experienced in the past 21 years of my life. I’d never left Toronto. I’d driven to Montreal, but I’d never been on a plane before two or three years ago.  Wow. That’s crazy. From when I was born to when I was 21, I never left Toronto. That’s why I’m such a city cat. Trilogy is my experiences in those four walls. Kiss Land is me doing the things I did in Trilogy in different settings.   My favorite of the Trilogy set, which goes against conventional wisdom, is Echoes of Silence. Really, the last one? Echoes of Silence was made in Montreal. I had a lot of darkness in that city.  My favorite song on that project is “Next.” That’s an artist’s song. If you’re an artist, you can relate to that record. Especially if you’re in that hip-hop world, “Next” is for you.  It’s that balance of high and low. To start a song off, “She pops that pussy on a Monday.” Where is this going from there? I’m a huge fan of R. Kelly’s. He’s a musical genius, and probably the most prolific artist of the generation before mine. Some of the lines he says, if you say them in a normal voice, it’s the most disgusting thing you could say to somebody. But I can say “Pussy-ass nigga” in the most elegant and sexiest way ever, and it’s accepted. If I can get away with singing that, I’m doing something right.  All that ignorance on my records — “When she put it in her mouth, she can’t seem to reach my…” — that’s me paying homage to R. Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent. The things R. Kelly was saying were crazy. You can say it now and it’s nothing, but back then you couldn’t.  Since Trilogy, you’ve made songs with Wiz, Juicy J, French Montana, Drake They are all friends of mine. Every time Wiz came to Toronto, my friend would take me to his concerts and bring me backstage. To this day, he’s the realest dude ever. So when he asked me to work with him, I did it without hesitation.  When you do a feature for other artists, do you give them an entire song? With “Crew Love,” it wasn’t like that. Like I said, that was my song. I had a hook and I had a second verse. And Drake heard it and he was like, “Fuck, man.”  There’s a second verse? Yeah, there was a second verse on it.  You’ve got to play that for me! I fucking hate that second verse. That was a complete freestyle as well. I’m glad Drake placed his vocals on it. That song was so special to him. I didn’t hear that verse until maybe four or five months after I gave it to him. Even with “The Zone,” I was scared I was going to have to put out Thursday before his verse came in because Drake takes his time. He makes sure that he says the right shit and his flow is on point.  It seems like your work on Take Care was similar to the way Kanye West enlisted Kid Cudi on 808s & Heartbreak. Or when Jay-Z hit up Kanye for The Blueprint.  Do you think Drake tapped you to give Take Care that feel? Yeah, he told me he wouldn’t be able to do the album without me. You can read it on the credits that he thanked me. I don’t know if that’s him being generous, but I gave him a lot of records. I made “Practice.”  What did you do on “Practice”? That whole hook was me. That’s probably the only song I wrote for Take Care. The rest of it was just shit I was going to have for . He really wanted to incorporate my sound, which was inspired by his sound. It’s not like, “Oh, I had the ‘new sound.’” It was just easier for him to relate to me, because it was his sound with an edge. It was that Toronto sound. So yeah, you’re right. I feel like I could have been that for his album.  People think you guys aren’t cool with each other anymore. No, that’s not true. Definitely not true. But it makes sense. The thing about Drake is I told him what my decisions were going to be. And he was down with it from the beginning.  You mean in terms of your label deal? Everything. I told him from day one what my decision was going to be. I wasn’t going that route. I was going to go my own route. And he supported me.  So when you read things about how you two are not cool… — he’s like me when it comes to shit like that, too. He loves reading that stuff.  You both just brush it off? Of course. I don’t like to spoon-feed people. I don’t like to be like, “You know what? I’m going to let the world know that we’re cool. We’re going to take a picture together. Everyone’s cool.” It’s all about the mystery, and people like it. Shit’s WWE, man. It’s wrestling, you know what I mean?  The other rumor is that you two are PartyNextDoor.  No, no, no, that’s not true at all. I never met him.  Where do you see yourself in the world of R&B? The only thing R&B about my shit is the style of singing. My inspiration is R. Kelly, Michael Jackson, and Prince, for the vocals anyway. My production and songwriting, and the environment around those vocals are not inspired by R&B at all.  I heard Portishead drums on “Belong to the World.” Yeah, that was the inspiration behind that. I wrote a letter to the producers of Portishead and let them know this album is inspired by them.  The entire Kiss Land album? Most of it. I find a sound and run with it. It varies from Stevie Nicks to Genesis and Phil Collins. The production is very cinematic for me, and R&B was never cinematic like that.  Do you have a greater understanding of love on this album? I don’t know. Like I said, a lot of it’s subconscious.  On “Belong to the World,” it sounds like you may have had a serious relationship. “Belong to the World” is about falling in love with the wrong person. There are some songs where I talk about the same person, but I like to make every song about someone else. Thursday is a conceptual album. Whatever that situation was, I spent the whole album focusing on that situation.  Have you gone through heartbreak before? I think I did. I’m not sure. Some people think they go through situations and then it hits them like a fucking brick. I hope that I fell in love and I hope that my heart was broken. Because if I didn’t, then I don’t know what I’m about to go through in the next 20 years of my life.  Last night in the studio you said Kiss Land was a ridiculous title. Yeah, because Kiss Land symbolizes the tour life, but it’s a world that I created in my head. Just like House of Balloons symbolizes Toronto and my experiences there, but it’s a world that I created. When I think about Kiss Land, I think about a terrifying place. It’s a place I’ve never been to before that I’m very unfamiliar with.  A lot of it is inspired by filmmakers like John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Ridley Scott, because they know how to capture fear. That’s what Kiss Land is to me, an environment that’s just honest fear. I don’t know who I am right now and I’m doing all these outlandish things in these settings that I’m not familiar with. To me, it’s the most terrifying thing ever. So when you hear the screams in the record and you hear all these horror references and you feel scared, listen to the music because I want you to feel what I’m feeling. Kiss Land is like a horror movie  Holy shit. That’s the last thing you’d expect from the title. I didn’t want to call it Dark World or something so generic. The title came from a conversation that I overheard and those words stuck out. Someone said, “Kiss Land” and I thought, “That’s going to be the title of my album.” It sounds so ridiculous. When I put  out everyone was like, “What the hell? This is going to be corny. It’s going to be all lovey-dovey.”  People will say, “It’s a wrap; we lost him.” But that’s what I want. I want them to be underwhelmed. I’m all about surprises. If you watch a horror movie and it’s called Kiss Land, it’s probably going to be the most terrifying thing you’ve ever seen in your life.', "" Aiyyo, all they wanna do is dance That's all they wanna do   This is that automatic I stay fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic P goes spastic, C galactic Southside boy, we Cadillac it Charismatic, Asiatic I hustle for mathematics Cameras, action, changed the status Actor tappin' yo' favorite actress Gucci rockin', coochies poppin' Movie watchin', booties droppin' Body movin', showin', provin' Stylin' and being fly (c'mon) I touch the masses like a Catholic Expensive rap shit, my future's backlit Interact with the cat who macks and stacks My vernac' attracts y'all react; so let's go, uhh   This is that new shit, keep 'em standing in line That universal mind control, now move yo' behind Uh, you know you like it; it's calling yo' name Nigga, this is that new shit, and it don't feel the same It's got that dang da-da-dang d-dang-a-dang dang Dang diggy dang d-dang-a-dang dang Bop bop, d-dang d-dang diggy diggy Bop bop, d-dang d-dang dang   Some pop, some lock, some move robotic Like cash money I stay in pocket U.M.C. r-r-r-rock, don't stop it Chicks exotic, mix Hpnotiq Superhero role boy, I'm bionic You a fad on some level, I'm a supersonic Girl, you 'bout it, you can strip like comic And trance to melodic Technotronic Beats knockin', seats droppin' Seeds poppin', streets rockin' Freakin', shakin, money makin' Stylin' and being fly I'm the one the ladies-ladies chose to Strip and pose to, take off their clothes to Toast to the one that go coast to coast to Mr. Global, the focal, let's go, uhh   This is that new shit, keep 'em standing in line That universal mind control, now move yo' behind Uh, you know you like it; it's calling yo' name Nigga, this is that new shit, and it don't feel the same It's got that dang da-da-dang d-dang-a-dang dang Dang diggy dang d-dang-a-dang dang Bop bop, d-dang d-dang diggy diggy Bop bop, d-dang d-dang dang   I am a renegade, I never been afraid Fresh and I'm get-tin paid The future future of this age!
